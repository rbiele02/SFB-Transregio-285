By using a high-pressure/higherature process (HP/HT), it is possible to synthesise new ultra-hard cutting materials called binderless nanocrystalline cubic boron nitride (BNNC). The starting material is a pyrolytically deposited hexagonal boron nitride (pBN), which is converted at temperatures of 1400 °C-2200 °C and pressures of 10-20 GPa in a direct synthesis without any binding material. The average crystallite size of this material is 50-100 nm and is thus significantly smaller than conventional polycrystalline cubic boron nitride (PCBN) cutting materials. Compared to conventional PCBN cutting materials, this material has an increased hardness, hot hardness and better temperature resistance. This provides an excellent alternative to extend the process limits for the machining of hardened steels and superalloys. In this conference paper, the first technological results for groove turning in hardened steels with this new promising cutting material will be presented.",,1,1,BMWi,undefined,Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Technologie

Materials and Methods: Using 200 porcine mandibles, 3 different monocortical plating techniques were evaluated. The condyles were fractured along a defined line tangentially through the sigmoid notch and perpendicular to the posterior border. After anatomic reduction, osteosynthesis was performed using either standard rhombic 3D condylar fracture plates and standard screws (group A) or locking rhombic 3D condylar fracture plates, which were fixed either with standard screws (group B) or locking screws (group C). For comparison, nonfractured condyles (group D) and condyles fixed with standard two 4-hole miniplates and 8 screws (group E) were included. Using a universal mechanical testing machine (TIRA Test 2720; TIRA GmbH Schalkau, Germany), each group was subjected to linear loading from laterally to medially, medially to laterally, anteriorly to posteriorly, and posteriorly to anteriorly. The maximum axial force and displacement at the maximum force were measured. The mean values were compared for statistical significance using analysis of variance with Bonferroni's correction (statistical significance set at P <.05). Results: The main mode of failure in the plating techniques investigated was the pull out of screws from the proximal fragment. We found no statistically significant differences in the stability of osteosynthesis between the two 4-hole miniplates and the rhombic 3D condylar fracture plate when loading from posteriorly to anteriorly, laterally to medially, and medially to laterally. However, when loading from anteriorly to posteriorly, a statistically significant difference between the standard and locking system and the two 4-hole miniplate system was observed, with the latter proving more stable. Conclusions: The results of the present biomechanical study suggest that the rhombic 3D condylar fracture plates are suitable for the treatment of condylar neck fractures. Both types of the plate are able to resist physiologic strains comparable to the two 4-hole miniplates.",,4,0,,undefined,

Forming processes generally lead to residual stresses. Compressive residual stresses can have a beneficial impact on the fatigue life of components, which is demonstrated here in terms of a skew-rolled hybrid shaft-hub connection. In order to set the basis for a systematic investigation of this effect, a strategy for the evaluation of the influence of residual stresses on the fatigue resistance of formed components is proposed. It involves the determination of the expectable residual stresses through a simulation of the forming process as well as a fatigue analysis. While state-of-the-art fatigue concepts assume unchanging cyclic material behaviour throughout the entire fatigue life of the component, this assumption is not adequate for residual stress-afflicted components. Hence, a generalization to transient cyclic material behaviour with an asymmetry in tension and compression is introduced.",Fatigue | Notch strain concept | Residual stresses | Skew rolling | Transient material behaviour,2,0,DFG,BR 3500/21-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The multi-material mix used nowadays requires several joints to establish a durable connection. It is necessary to test the joints without harming the parts to ensure the safety of the whole structure. Therefore, a new approach for a non-destructive testing method is presented and validated in this paper. The aim is to establish the testing routine as a fast and easy alternative to the few known non-destructive testing procedures. The approach measures the dissipation of energy by detecting the propagated waves on the surfaces of the joining partners next to the joint. After a short description and a theoretical insight in wave propagation, the experimental results will be substantiated by simulated findings. A bolted connection was chosen in the experiments due to the possibility to easily apply and check different torque moments. The simulation model was adapted and tested for different applied contact pressures. The general results show a detectable loss of energy that can be linked to different torque moments. Different effects are visible in the simulation and the experiments and will be described. The findings will be discussed and an short outlook will be given. The aim of proving the concept via experimental and simulated results was reached.",Mechanical joints | Non-destructive testing | Torque moment analysis | Wave energy dissipation,0,0,,undefined,

Published by Elsevier B.V. Numerical simulations of sheet metal forming operations in industrial applications require a precise description of the material behavior regarding yielding and damage evolution in order to obtain a precise prediction of the process windows. Diverse experimental tests referring to multiaxial stress conditions as biaxial, uniaxial tension and shear are required for the calibration of the corresponding models. Recently, a new method for stress determination on digital image correlation data (DIC data) was proposed, which can be used for efficient parameter identification of the yielding behavior, but also for direct damage determination. Focus of this work is the application of this technique for damage characterization on heterogeneous tensile tests. Heterogeneous tests show great potential in reducing the number of required experimental tests as a wide stress range is applied with one single test. Two complex notched uniaxial specimen are proposed and tested for a mild steel. For these tests, damage fields based on Cockcroft-Latham criterion and triaxiality-strain curves were calculated using the new technique. Furthermore, the obtained results and the suitability of methodology for damage characterization are discussed.",Damage | Forming | Heterogeneous test | Sheet metal,1,1,AiF,IGF 18143BG,Allianz Industrie Forschung

The reproducibility of the restraining force is analyzed for binders with a drawbead and different locations of the surface pressure in material flow direction, so called pressure zones. Therefore, an experimental strip tensile test is carried out and the characteristic and scatter of the restraining force is analyzed for the different pressure zones. The surface roughening of the sheet caused by the drawbead is identified as an important influencing factor on the reproducibility of the restraining force. An increased surface roughness leads to a decreased sensitivity of the friction to variations in the amount of lubricant. Thus, the robustness of the drawing process can be increased by an appropriate choice of the pressure zone.",Binder pressure zone | Drawbead | Robustness | Sheet metal,2,1,,undefined,

These are the most examined phases, whereas the after-sales sector is a nonetheless important part of the lifecycle. After sales includes the repair of damaged automobile structures after road accidents. Increasing demands for safety and comfort lead to the request for feasible repair methods which create equal mechanical characteristics of the body structures such as the original set up.

Thermally conductive polymers offer new possibilities for the heat dissipation in electric and electronic components, for example, by a three-dimensional shaping of the heat sinks. To face safety regulations, improved fire performance of those components is required. In contrast to unfilled polymers, those materials exhibit an entirely different thermal behavior. To investigate the flammability, a phosphorus flame retardant was incorporated into thermally conductive composites of polyamide 6 and hexagonal boron nitride. The flame retardant decreased the thermal conductivity only slightly. However, the burning behavior changed significantly, due to a different heat propagation, which was investigated using a thermographic camera. An optimum content of hexagonal boron nitride for a sufficient thermal conductivity and fire performance was found between 20 and 30 vol%. The improvement of the fire performance was due to a faster heat release out of the pyrolysis zone and an earlier decomposition of the flame retardant. For higher contents of hexagonal boron nitride, the heat was spread faster within the part, promoting an earlier ignition and increasing the decomposition rate of the flame retardant.",aluminum diethylphosphinate | hexagonal boron nitride | polyamide 6 | thermally conductive polymers | thermography,0,0,CSC,57207457,China Scholarship Council

The measured data can be fitted well with Kamal-Sourour's model modified by the diffusion correlation according to Chern and Poehlein. After that, the influence of filler content and size on the kinetic parameters are presented discussed. The results show that the ultimate glass transition temperature is significantly lower for pure epoxy resin (EP) than for compounds filled with surface-treated glass beads, which have an essential effect on the diffusion-controlled reaction at different curing temperatures. For the surface-treated glass beads used in this study, the reaction speed in the early curing stage is accelerated by increasing filler content or decreasing of filler size. In the later curing stage, the reaction speeds of compounds with higher filler content or smaller fillers reduce more quickly. The study of reaction kinetics indicates that the activation energy Ea1, Ea2, the reaction order m, and n are affected differently by varying filler content and size.",Diffusion | Epoxy molding compound (EMC) | Filler content | Filler size | Isothermal DSC | Kamal-Sourour's model | Reaction kinetics,2,1,FAU,undefined,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg

Filler materials are widely used in combination with polymer materials. Conventional filler particles generally cause light scattering and absorption because of their optical characteristic or refractive index difference. With nanoparticles (NPs) as a filler material, it is theoretically possible to manufacture transparent compounds due to their small particle dimensions reducing the interaction with light. Nevertheless, the particles tend to build agglomerates and aggregates which reduce the composite’s transparency considerably. This review gives an overview of the effect different particle materials have on the properties of transparent polymer composites with consideration of the composite’s transparency. There are very few reports on highly transparent and thick (>1 mm) polymer nanocomposites with such an amount of particles that affect other properties of the polymer significantly. In the majority of cases, NPs lead to a significant lower transparency. This indicates that the homogeneous dispersion of the particles is still a major difficulty in producing transparent nanocomposites with enhanced properties.",Nanocomposites | nanofillers | transparent composites | transparent fillers | transparent polymers,2,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

In this study, epoxy molding compounds (EMC) filled with glass beads were fabricated with a twin-screw-extruder (TSE) and tempered before further processing to generate different degrees of cross-linking (0–15%) in the compounds. After that, the compounds were injection-molded into tensile samples with and without weld lines to investigate the influence of pre-cross-linking of compounds on the weld line strength. Both the referent fracture strength and the weld line strength were improved with the increase of pre-cross-linking in compounds. Especially, cavities in the weld line area were reduced presumably due to the improved venting with the increased viscosity. For the resized samples without notches, their weld line strength are higher than those with notches. The in-mold pressure of more pre-cross-linked compounds can be hold longer than less pre-cross-linked compounds. This could lead to a better compensation of the material shrinkage. This might be the reason for the improved weld line strength for more pre-cross-linked compounds.",Curing degree | Epoxy molding compound (EMC) | Flow-hardening behavior | In-mold pressure | Melt flow behavior | Thermosets injection molding | Weld line strength,1,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

To make better use of fiber reinforced polymer composites in automotive applications, a clearer knowledge of its interfacial properties under dynamic and thermal loadings is necessary. In the present study, the interfacial behavior of glass fiber reinforced polypropylene (PP) composites under different loading temperatures and strain rates were investigated via molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation results reveal that PP molecules move easily to fit tensile deformation at higher temperatures, resulting in a lower interfacial strength of glass fiber-PP interface. The interfacial strength is enhanced with increasing strain rate because the atoms do not have enough time to relax at higher strain rates. In addition, the non-bonded interaction energy plays a crucial role during the tensile deformation of composites. The damage evolution of glass fiber-PP interface followsWeibull's distribution. At elevated temperatures, tensile loading is more likely to cause cohesive failure because the mechanical property of PP is lower than that of the glass fiber-PP interface. However, at higher strain rates, the primary failure mode is interfacial failure because the strain rate dependency of PP is more pronounced than that of the glass fiber-PP interface. The relationship between the failure modes and loading conditions obtained by molecular dynamics simulation is consistent with the author's previous experimental studies.",Adhesion | Interface | Molecular dynamics simulation | Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs),5,1,NSFC,51905552,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Due to the cost-efficient injection molding process and its high degree of freedom in design injection molded gears are widely used in actuating drives. One important functional requirement is the positioning precision of these systems. In gear applications, this precision is mostly dependent on the transmission error. Therefore, a lot of effort in mold design and construction is spent on ensuring acceptable transmission errors of injection molded plastic spur gears. To predict the transmission error of injection molded spur gears, an integrative simulation method is developed in this work. First, the injection molding process is simulated. The resulting gear geometry is transferred to the mechanical model of a flank-rolling test to evaluate the transmission error. The transmission error is mainly dependent on the local shrinkage and warpage caused in the solidification processes during injection molding, which in turn are influenced primary by tool design and process parameters. It is shown, that accurate simulation results concerning gear geometry, require a precise modeling of the process, tool and material. This includes accurate modelling of injection and temperature parameters, gate and cooling design, and behavior of the material. The simulation of the flank-rolling test has to take the specified reference torque and testing speed into account to ensure a realistic prediction of the resulting transmission errors. The research is done on gears with module 1 mm and 39 teeth. According to the model, the gate design has the highest influence on the transmission error. An increase in transmission error of 100% is predicted for gears with three symmetric pin-point gates compared to a central pin-point gate, and an increase of 50% for an eccentric pin-point gate. Therefore, if sufficiently modeled, a realistic prediction of transmission errors is possible.",,0,0,DFG,DR-421/21-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

In order to achieve sustainable and resource-saving products, the use of intelligent lightweight design is a current trend. One approach is the implementation of multi-material systems. However, the joining technology poses a key challenge when combining different materials like continuous fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTP) and metal or joining steel and aluminium. Due to different material properties and partial chemical incompatibilities, established joining techniques without auxiliary element, like welding or clinching, are reaching their limits. Joining dissimilar materials through pin structures has proven as a possible strategy to produce hybrid multi-material systems on a laboratory scale. Nevertheless, this technology is hardly used in mass production due to the currently complex, uneconomical pin manufacturing process. In this work, cold forming is presented as a promising approach for the production of such pins. In a first step, the pins are extruded from a steel sheet (DC04). In a second step, the steel sheets are joined with aluminium (EN AW-6016) or CFRTP by either pressing pins directly into the material or by caulking pins with a pre-punched joining partner. The material for the pin is extruded directly from the sheet metal thus preventing additional weight in contrast to fasteners. In addition, the direct press-fit is a suitable method to achieve a tightly sealed joint. Within this work, the extrusion of the pin, as well as the two different joining operations, are investigated showing the fundamental applicability and the potential of the new joining process. In order to analyse the applicability of the joining operation shear tensile tests are conducted.",,1,0,DFG,EN 196/13-2,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

A major challenge in manufacturing polymer-metal electronic systems, for example, encapsulations of metal inserts using assembly injection molding, is to create a tight sealing in order to prevent leakage. One typical reason for leakage is the formation of gaps between polymer and metal. Through labyrinth seals, which can be manufactured by structuring of the metal surface, the gap-based leakage networks can be interrupted. However, in order to use the appropriate structure in the right position, knowledge about the formation of the gaps is essential. The research covered in this paper focuses on the analysis of the formation of gap-based leakages in polymer-metal electronic systems with labyrinth seals to improve the component design of such parts. The effects of different embossed labyrinth seals, which differ in depth and features, and an electrochemically manufactured areal seal on the tightness and leakage position are investigated. Furthermore, the formation of the leakage network is presented for the investigated variants.",embossing | joints | multi-material systems | surface treatments | tightness,0,1,DFG,ME 2043/33-2,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Thermoforming is one of the most important processes in polymer processing. In the packaging industry, thermoformed parts such as blister packs are manufactured from amorphous plastics such as polystyrene (PS) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC). In the field of semi-crystalline thermoplastics, mainly standard thermoplastics, such as, for example, polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), or polyethylene terephthalate (PET), are used. There is limited literature dealing with the thermoforming of thin filled systems. Filler bonding, in particular, represents a major challenge in strain rheology. Electron irradiation is a way to generate improved filler-matrix bonding. In this study, the influence of fillers and radiation-crosslinking on the elongation behaviour and on the wall thickness distribution was investigated. At higher areal draw ratios, an enormous benefit of radiation-crosslinking of thin filled sheets is shown. While non-crosslinked specimens could not be formed, it was possible to thermoform radiation-crosslinked sheets filled with 10 vol.% glass fibres. Furthermore, with the higher areal draw ratio, the influence of the filler orientation on the stretching behaviour became more apparent.",anisotropic properties | elongational behaviour | glass fibre | radiation-crosslinking | reinforcement | thermoforming,0,0,DFG,DR 421/20-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Influenced by the interfacial interaction, the atomic density is at its largest near the interface. As the separation continues, growing voids are observed near the interface. Polymer chains close to the Al substrate are greatly stretched, while the chains far away from the interface are relatively steady. Nevertheless, the changes in radius of gyration during the separation are much higher regardless of the substrate structures.

According to the current model of isothermal laser sintering, semi-crystalline thermoplastics need to be processed within a certain temperature range, resulting in the simultaneous presence of the material both in a molten and solid state, which is present during part building. Based on this process model, high cycle times ranging from hours to days are a thought to be a necessity to avoid warpage. In this paper, the limited validity of the model of isothermal laser sintering is shown by various experiments, as ongoing solidification could be detected a few layers below the powder bed surface. The results indicate that crystallization and material solidification is initiated at high temperatures and further progresses throughout part build-up in z-direction. Therefore, a process-adapted material characterization was performed to identify the isothermal crystallization kinetics at processing temperature and to track changes of the material state over time. A dual approach on measuring surface temperatures by infrared thermography and additional thermocouple measurements in z-direction was performed to identify further influences on the material solidification. A model experiment revealed that a few millimeters below the surface, components produced by LS are already solidified.

Generally, the strength at the weld line of the injection molded part is very weak. The heat transfer coefficient (HTC) between the polymer melt and the mold cavity surface was analyzed to solve this problem. The surface roughness of the mold cavity and the material of the mold insert were changed to adjust the interface environment between the polymer melt and the mold cavity surface. HTC was obtained by combing the experimental measurement with the theoretical calculation. In the current study, the influence of HTC on the tensile strength of the weld line of the molded specimen was investigated. The results show that the weld line strength of the molded specimen increases with the decrease in HTC between the polymer and the mold cavity surface.

However, many of these techniques are based on the characterization of dry fabrics and are not suitable for CFRTs due to their low bending stiffness at elevated temperatures. This study presents a new approach for assessing the bending behavior of continuous fiber reinforced plastics at elevated temperatures based on a variation of the single cantilever test. An acute angled piston is used to apply a deflection onto a unilaterally fixed sample while the reaction forces are measured. The bending line is evaluated by cooling and re-solidification of the deflected samples and subsequent high-resolution scans of vertically oriented samples. The results show the suitability of the presented approach to characterize and quantify the bending behavior of CFRTs under processing conditions, allowing for a differentiation of the behavior of different geometrical sections of a woven fabric. Based on a classical viscoelastic behavior, quasi-plastic flow can be identified when the applied deformation speed and relaxation speed reach an equilibrium. Shear deformation appears to increasingly dominate the deformation behavior at low bending radii and high deflections. Additional research is required to evaluate influences of different temperature levels and deformation speeds on the bending behavior and the previously described relationship of relaxation and deformation.",Bending line | Organo-sheet | Quasi-plastic flow | Viscoelasticity,1,0,,undefined,

In the product manufacturing cycle, the joining of polymers often takes a central position. Vibration welding is characterized by short cycle times, high process flexibility and stability as well as by the achievement of high bond strengths without using additives. However, the vibration welding process is clearly restricted by a necessary adhesion compatibility of the joining partners. By means of structuring one joining partner and subsequent filling of the structures by a second joining partner, the joining by form-fit using vibration welding enables the combination of adhesion incompatible polymers. Within these investigations, bonds between adhesion incompatible semi-crystalline thermoplastics were generated based on mechanical adhesion. Also semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers could be connected for the first time without any connecting elements, although they conventionally do not show mechanical resilience.

The industrial use of these procedures for prototypes or smallscale production lines has grown due to their specific characteristics like the high achievable complexity. With the increasing demand for electrification and functionalization, the combination of AM with laser-direct structuring (LDS) gains interest. Therefore, the powder used for the investigation is dry coated with a LDS-additive, which enables laser activation and a metallization of the activated sections in a metallization bath. To characterize the influence of the LDS-additive on the process, the powder properties were investigated for unfilled and successive increased additive content. The thermal process window was identified by standard and process adapted isothermal differential scanning calorimetry. This showed a decrease of the isothermal crystallization time due to nucleation effects of the additive. Subsequently, parts were produced with a parameter study and showed a demand for a higher energy density. The resulting parts were then metallized with a parameter variation and characterized by stereomicroscopy. To investigate the influence of the different parameter sets and the LDS content, the mechanical properties were determined.",,0,0,,undefined,

Microfluidic chips have been widely applied in biochemical analysis, DNA sequencing, and disease diagnosis due to their advantages of miniaturization, low consumption, rapid analysis, and automation. Injection molded microfluidic chips have attracted great attention because of their short processing time, low cost, and mass production. The microchannel is the critical element of a microfluidic chip, and thus the microchannel replicability directly affects the performance of the microfluidic chip. In the current paper, a new method is proposed to evaluate the replicability of the microchannel profile via the root mean square value of the actual profile curve and the ideal profile curve of the microchannel. To investigate the effects of injection molding parameters (i.e., mold temperature, melting temperature, holding pressure, holding time, and injection rate) on microchannel replicability, a series of single-factor experiments were carried out. The results showed that, within the investigated experimental range, the increase of mold temperature, melt temperature, holding pressure, holding time, and injection rate could improve microchannel replicability accuracy. Specifically, the microchannels along the flow direction of the polymer melt were significantly affected by the mold temperature and melt temperature. Moreover, the replicability of the microchannel was influenced by the distance from the injection gate. The effect of microchannel replication on electrophoresis was demonstrated by a protein electrophoresis experiment.",Injection molding | Microchannel | Microfluidic chip | Replicability accuracy,3,1,NSFC,2012CB025905,National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)

To introduce thermoset resins into the SLS process, the time-temperature-dependent curing behavior of the thermoset and the infiltration have to be understood to assess the process behavior. The curing properties were analyzed using a rotational viscometer. Furthermore, the fundamental infiltration behavior was analyzed with micro-dosing infiltration experiments.

Thermal bonding technology is the most commonly used approach in bonding injection-molded microfluidic chips. Although the bonding mechanism is still under debate, the molecular dynamics (MD) method can provide insight into the bonding process on a macromolecular level. In this study, MD simulations for thermal bonding of PMMA substrate and cover sheet were performed. The molecule configuration and density distribution during the thermal bonding process were studied. The effects of bonding pressure on the equivalent strain, joining energy and diffusion coefficient were investigated. The debonding process was simulated to analyze the bonding strength and failure mechanism. Simulation results show that penetration mainly takes place near the interface area. Although the final density increases slightly with increasing pressure, the bonding interface is still insufficiently filled. The equivalent strain grows faster than that in the later stage because of the gap at the interface. The bonding pressure shows clear effects on the joining energy, diffusion coefficient and stress-strain behavior. Tensile failure occurs at the interface, with PMMA chains stretched between two layers. The majority of the change in potential energy is correlated with the change in non-bonded energy. At yield strain, the low-density defect at the interface weakens the tensile strength of bonded chip.",Bonding pressure | Debonding | Microfluidic chip | Molecular dynamics simulation | PMMA | Thermal bonding,6,1,NSFC,2018M632983,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation

The additive manufacturing process of the laser sintering of polymers (LS) allows the production of complex parts right from CAD data. However, the manufactured parts often show dimensional inaccuracies. In order to fundamentally determine the influencing parameters on the accuracy of LS parts, a hatching specimen, a layer-specimen and defined part geometries are manufactured and subsequently measured. These, combined with a theoretical observation of the layer wise geometry buildup, are used to determine the fundamental portions of the development of dimensions in building direction (z-direction). The results indicated a defined powder adhesion height at the top and the bottom of a melted layer, along with the dependency of melt depth and the hatch number for small structures.

These signal transmitter can be produced economically in the injection molding process using compounds consisting of hard magnetic particles embedded in a polymer matrix, so-called polymer bonded magnets. By integrating a magnetic field inside the mold an orientation of the particles in the polymer melt as well as a partial magnetization can be conducted, such that the second magnetization step is not required. This paper deals with the influence of the cooling conditions on the orientation of the particles as well as the final magnetic properties, such as the resulting pole length accuracy.

Regardless of colouration for functional or aesthetic purposes, technical polymer parts, like gears, require consistent properties. However, there is a lack of research into the effect of colourants on the tribomechanical properties of gears. Therefore, the effects of two pigments, titanium dioxide (white) and chrome antimony titanium oxide (yellow), and three delivery methods, masterbatch, liquid colour and direct compounding, on part morphology, dimensions, tribological and mechanical performance of injection-moulded polyoxymethylene (POM) spur gears are investigated in this paper. The white pigment accelerates the crystallisation of POM, causing fine and highly-crystalline morphological structures and smaller dimensions. However, the yellow pigment decelerates crystallisation, resulting in a coarser morphology with highly crystalline core material and bigger parts. Furthermore, the delivery method affects only the tribomechanical properties. Using a masterbatch decreases loads at break and increases deflection at break, since the carrier material acts as an impact modifier and a weak spot. The liquid colour decreases wear due to lubricating properties, whereas the pure pigments increases abrasion, especially in combination with a coarse microstructure. However, the effects of carrier systems and changes in morphology are always superimposed. Considering the performance and tolerance of technical components, colourants have to be carefully selected to ensure beneficial properties.",colouration | nucleation | polymer gears | tribology | wear,4,1,,undefined,

For protection of electronic components against environmental influences, an innovative surface structuring process based on a sintered powder layer was investigated. The applied treatment process leads to micro undercuts on the insert surface, which can result in an increased bond quality and reduced leakage rates because of labyrinth sealing effects. With this new method, entire assemblies or specific components can be protected by manufacturing in assembly injection molding, which would enable the use of an efficient and mass production suitable process for assembly protection.

Therefore, thermographic infrared measurements were conducted within a selective beam melting system to determine the resulting temperature fields during laser exposure in xy-direction. The present results indicate a strong influence of process parameters, such as scan speed, laser power and scan vector length on resulting temperatures during and after exposure.

All rights reserved. To maintain functional tolerances of gear sets over their lifetime, especially in polymer-seel gear sets, the wear behaviour must be considered. The state of the art in wear modelling does not take the run-in behaviour of polymer-metal contacts into account. This results in oversizing of wear allowances in the stationary wear phase and undersizing in the run-in phase. Therefore, a modified wear model is presented in this paper. With this method the issues of over- and undersizing can be eliminated. The method is then applied in a case study to show two things. Firstly, using the presented method the calculated necessary wear allowances were reduced by 30%. Secondly, the effect of surface structures on the wear behaviour was investigated. It is shown that the run-in process is not dependent on roughness in sliding direction, but on overall contact area. Thus, the state of the art, i.e. tolerating only the roughness in sliding direction, is insufficient. Considering the process-induced surface topology during design of gear sets can decrease run-in wear. Together with the optimised wear model, this allows wider manufacturing tolerances and thus lower costs during production.",Design practice | Optimisation | Surface structure | Tolerance representation and management | Wear,0,1,DFG,HMUE 20J43U/55D-1Q anWd WQAX29P13E/1H9-1U,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

A new method for the measurement of two-dimensional heat flux profiles for GTAW processes is presented. The method is based on a least squares reconstruction algorithm for the inverse heat transfer problem for a steady-state temperature distribution in a specimen body. The temperature is measured with an experimental setup suited for the heat input of a welding process. The temperature distribution is then used to reconstruct the heat flux distribution on the specimen surface using a heat flux approach function. To calculate the temperature distribution ratio for the current approach heat flux profile, a numerical simulation model of the specimen is embedded in the reconstruction procedure. The residuum between the actual temperature distribution and the test function temperature is reduced using a least squares optimization step until convergence. The method is verified using a numerically calculated temperature distribution which is compared with a predefined heat flux profile. Moreover, the method is compared with a split-anode measurement for one-dimensional and two-dimensional reconstruction approaches. Measurements of a process with an inclined torch as well as a process with a magnetically deflected arc demonstrate the capability of the new method for the measurement of two-dimensionally resolved heat flux distributions of GTAW processes.",Heat flux density | Inverse heat transfer | Numerical heat conduction | Split-anode | Welding,1,0,,undefined,

Capacitor discharge welding primarily applies to projection welding. Components with ring projections up to 200 mm diameter can be welded with peak currents up to 1000 kA and welding times less than 10 ms. Weld nuggets are expected to occur, as the CD-Welding belongs to resistance welding. Although the required strength is given, welding nuggets in cross-sections cannot invariably be verified. According to recent researches, joining occurs without a welding nugget, but with metal vaporisation and linked activation of the surfaces. This process is called short-time welding with high thermal current density. The type of the welded joint depends on the heating properties in the weld zone. Different welding energies, electrode forces and welding times result in different welded joints.

Resistance spot welding is used as a high-productivity joining process for the increasing use of lightweight materials in industrial applications. The main challenge for the welding of aluminum alloys is the wear of the electrodes. Due to the natural oxide layers on the metal surface, high contact resistances exist between the sheet metal and the electrode. This results in increased heat generation at this interface, which leads to increased alloyage on the electrode. Breaking the insulating natural oxide layers can be achieved by a friction-free or friction-assisted motion overlay and leads to a reduced electrode wear. The complex physical correlations involved are currently being investigated in a basic research project at TU Dresden. In addition to welding tests on a test rig, simulation-based analyses are also carried out. These allow a physic-based modeling of the effects and can be used later on for an extrapolation of any resistance welding process with motion overlay. In this paper, first experimental and analytical considerations for the mechanical destruction of the oxide layer of aluminum are discussed. Subsequently, the developed extended simulation model is presented and compared according to the quality of simulation of the welding process with motion overlay.

Gradient schemes for the cell centered finite volume method on unstructured grids, namely, the divergence theorem and the least squares schemes, have been widely adopted because they have reached a high precision for most applications. These schemes assume continuously differentiable fields for the calculation of the gradients. However, this assumption is violated in the vicinity of conductivity jumps between cells. It is shown that this deficiency leads to a wrong calculation of the gradients and thus the flux density in cells near conductivity changes. For large conductivity jumps, the error of the flux density can exceed several orders of magnitude. Based on theoretical considerations, flux conservative versions of the schemes are derived for the central gradient scheme and extended to the divergence theorem and least squares schemes. The modified schemes named flux conservative divergence theorem and flux conservative least squares take the nonlinearity of a conservation variable near conductivity changes into account and eliminate the error made by the assumption of a continuously differentiable field. The schemes are demonstrated on Cartesian and highly skewed grids with different grid resolutions with a large conductivity jump. The error of the flux density is shown to be reduced by several orders of magnitude up to machine precision for Cartesian grids.",,2,0,,undefined,

In order to do so the effect of electrode geometries on the electrode life is investigated.

The reason for this behavior is explained by a numerical simulation developed by the TU Dresden. Based on these findings, an analysis with the purpose of investigating an improved electrode geometry is conducted.

Synergistic effects during hybrid laser-arc welding may cause increased process efficiencies. However, the basic interactions behind these effects are still being discussed, with some contradictory reports. In this study, particular welding parameters of interest were systematically varied to further the understanding of involved phenomena. The experimental trials are evaluated regarding their synergistic achievements in terms of process efficiency, melting efficiency and energy coupling efficiency using a factorial two-level Design-of-Experiment (DoE) approach. The results show that the growth in process efficiency can be attributed to a dramatic increase in melting efficiency whereas the energy coupling efficiency is only moderately increased. Thus, the synergistic effect is mainly caused by secondary mechanisms that change the energy usage inside the workpiece while direct interactions between the two heat sources can be excluded as a reasonable cause for increased process efficiencies. It is concluded that the different sizes of the heat sources change the heat and mass flow positively and consequently lead to a higher performance level.",Hybrid welding | Interaction mechanisms | Laser welding | Plasma arc welding | Process efficiency | Synergistic effects,3,1,DFG,BE 1875/34-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Applications of structural concrete require use of reinforcement in one form or another. The known reinforcement concepts in additive concrete construction typically rely on conventional reinforcement approaches, which provide a solid basis for structural design, since existing guidelines and codes can be used. However, the use of conventional steel reinforcement poses serious limitations to the digitalization and automation of fabrication techniques. The article at hand presents two alternative approaches of reinforcing 3D-printed concrete structures: (1) additive manufacturing of steel reinforcement elements, (2) use of high-performance microfiber to achieve strain-hardening behavior of printed concrete. For both approaches materials and manufacturing techniques are briefly described followed by the results of mechanical testing and complimentary microscopic investigations. The printed steel bars showed similar mechanical performance in comparison to ordinary steel bars of the same cross-section area and comparable bond behavior to concrete too, as observed in pull-out experiments.

In experimental and numerical studies essential geometrical and material parameters influencing the forming behavior are identified and evaluated. Thereby, the inline-thermoclinching technology is developed by integrating the pre-processed steps of cutting and heating into the actual joining process. For structural analysis of the joining zone as well as for quality analysis and validation of the process simulations computer tomography (CT) is used. Furthermore, experimental characterizations of the failure behavior of thermoclinched joints and the development of simulation models as well as strategies for numerical strength analyses are carried out.",Clinching | hybrid structure | joint | multi-material | process simulation,1,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

This study investigates how the microstructure of a low-alloyed air-hardening steel either with a homogeneous, a dual-phase, or a bimodal grain structure influences its mechanical and fatigue performances. The homogeneous ferritic grain microstructure of the steel sheets is adjusted by an intercritical annealing at 790 °C, along with subsequent air hardening to obtain a dual-phase state. Then, the ferritic-martensitic material is cold-rolled and annealed at 550–700 °C to produce different bimodal grain microstructures. The evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties are characterized. An annealing temperature of 600 °C is considered to be the optimal temperature resulting in pronounced bimodal grain size distribution. The sheet with a bimodal microstructure exhibits a higher strength and equal ductility compared to one with a homogeneous ferritic microstructure. Additionally, high-cycle fatigue tests of the material with a bimodal microstructure shows its superior fatigue behavior at a loading of above 800 000 cycles compared with both the homogeneous ferritic microstructure as well as the dual-phase microstructure.",bimodal microstructure | dual-phase microstructure | ductility | low-alloy air-hardening steel | tensile and fatigue strength | thin sheet,0,1,,undefined,

The present experimental work is devoted to the analysis of strain parameters at rolling of aluminium composite with wire-reinforcement. The experiments on roll bonding of two strips of EN AW-5083 alloy with and without diagonal stainless steel net-reinforcement between them were carried out with different reductions. The rolling reduction was varied in a range from 25 to 55% and its influence on the straining of the wires and bonding mechanisms was analysed. The parameters describing the net behaviour in the composite established and used are the following: net cell elongation, wire elongation and wire ovalisation. The properties of the rolled composite are determined by means of longitudinal and transversal tensile testing, impact testing and microscopic analysis. The influence of the rolling reduction on the mechanisms of bonding formation in the composite, its properties and fracture behaviour are analysed. The optimum range of rolling reductions was established based on the conducted tests. The reinforcing net allowed reaching a tough bonding between the strip’s layers during rolling at lower plastic reduction, while the strips without reinforcement could not be bonded at rolling reduction below 45%. The wire-reinforced strips showed higher strength and ductility under the tensile loading in rolling direction and higher toughness during impact testing than the non-reinforced aluminium strips.",Aluminium matrix | Delamination | Mechanical properties | Reinforcing | Rolling | Steel net | Strain,1,0,DAAD,undefined,Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst

Hot rolling of thin sheets of hardenable aluminum alloys with integrated quenching allows the coupling of both deformation and heat treatment into a single processing step, analogous to hot extrusion. However, unlike hot extrusion, hot rolling is performed in a lower temperature range as a result of material contact with the unheated forming tool during deformation. The influence of this type of processing on mechanical properties has rarely been studied. In the present work, the effect of the individual parameters of hot rolling with integrated heat treatment on the microstructure and mechanical properties of alloy EN AW-6082 has been studied. The results have been compared with similarly heat-treated unworked material. It has been revealed that hot rolling can cause the strength of the material to deteriorate after final natural and artificial aging, leading to a failure to fulfil the requirements of standards.

All rights reserved. One of the strategies employed to lower weight and to decrease material consumption is reducing part thickness itself. Thus, functionally graded materials in which structural reinforcement is adjusted locally, are of great interest. With regard to conventional industrial processes, such as extrusion or flexible cold rolling, thickness variations can only be achieved either longitudinally or through the cross-section of the semi-finished products. Hence, a combined thickness variation (along both axes) is difficult to generate solely by extrusion or rolling. A simultaneous thickness variation in both directions, however, would enable further weight savings in structural components such as car body parts. In this study, a promising approach with extruded shapes, serving as a billet for a flexible hot rolling process, is elaborated upon. By employing the described process modification, shapes with simultaneous thickness variations in longitudinal as well as in transverse direction are feasible. Initial numerical analysis reveals the weight-saving potential of using these semi-finished products for structural parts in a car body. A demonstration of the production process for the semi-finished parts and the occurring challenges are discussed. To verify and adjust the new technology, a numerical model of the flexible hot rolling process has been created based on the finite element software QForm VX. This model is also employed for tool design optimization to produce semi-finished components with the required geometrical quality. Finally, the results of hot rolling experiments conducted using the adjusted roll design are presented.",Aluminum | Extruded Shape | Hot Deformation | Rolling,0,1,,undefined,

Whilst Z-pins are primarily used to mitigate delamination under quasi-static loading and/or impact events, the effectiveness of TTR following long-term exposure to cyclic loads still needs to be properly understood. This paper aims to fill the aforementioned knowledge gap by addressing the effect of fatigue on the Z-pins themselves, both in mode I and mode II regimes. The fatigue tests considered here are carried out on single Z-pin coupons, as well as Double-Cantilever-Beam (DCB) and End-Loaded-Split (ELS) specimens. The results indicate that, for relatively small cyclic displacements, Z-pins tolerate fatigue well, exhibiting good residual performance post-fatigue. However, increasing the amplitude of the fatigue loads damages the Z-pins and, hence, it tends to reduce the TTR residual ability to mitigate delamination under further quasi-static or impact loading.",A. 3-Dimensional reinforcement | B.

The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurement indicates that the incorporation of GO and rGO has a remarkable impact on the crystallinity of the nanocomposites (an increase of crystallization temperature up to 58 °C for nanocomposite containing 1.0 wt.% of GO is observed).

Selected methods for determining fatigue life in the strain-life approach, described by the Manson-Coffin-Basquin (MCB) equation based on results of static tensile tests are presented in this paper. These methods served for determining low-cycle characteristics for 1.2344 steel applied for dies used in forging at high temperatures. The authors presented the results of tensile tests performed at room temperature and at elevated temperatures (300 °C, 500 °C, 600 °C, and 700 °C). Data obtained from these tests enabled to theoretically determine fatigue life characteristics according to the methods: universal slope, 4-point correlation, Mitchell’s, modified universal slope method, Bäumel’s and Seeger’s method, modified 4-point-correlation method, Roessle’s and Fatemi’s method, as well as median method. Curves obtained on this basis were then compared to charts obtained from periodic deformation tests. Results obtained in this manner were compared to actual wear of tools (made of 1.2344 steel) used in the hot forging process of a cover-type forging. Fatigue tests covered deformation of specimens with uniaxial, periodically variable load until their cracking, and were performed at temperatures 20 °C, 300 °C, and 600 °C and at four levels of total strain εac: 0.5%, 0.8%, 1.0%, and 2.0%. Clear differences between the values of coefficients and exponents of the MCB equation were observed depending on the applied theoretical method and depending on test temperature. The research goal is description of different methods for determining fatigue life in strain-life approach based on results of static tensile tests and comparison them with the results from experiment. This will allow choosing the best method to predict the fatigue life of tools made of steel 1.2344 and usage of this method in the future, saving time, and costs related to the performance of experimental tests.",Hot forging | Low-cycle fatigue | Tools durability,3,0,,undefined,

Understanding the composite damage formation process and its impact on mechanical properties is a key step towards further improvement of material and higher use. For its accelerated application, furthermore, practice-related modeling strategies are to be established. In this collaborative study, the damage behavior of carbon fiber-reinforced composites under cyclic loading with load reversals is analyzed experimentally and numerically. The differences of crack density evolution during constant amplitude and tension-compression block-loading is characterized with the help of fatigue tests on cross-ply laminates. For clarifying the evolving stress-strain behavior of the matrix during static and fatigue long-term loading, creep, and fatigue experiments with subsequent fracture tests on neat resin samples are applied. The local stress redistribution in the composite material is later evaluated numerically using composite representative volume element (RVE) and matrix models under consideration of viscoelasticity. The experimental and numerical work reveals the strong influence of residual stresses and the range of cyclic tension stresses to the damage behavior. On the microscopic level, stress redistribution dependent on the mean stress takes place and a tendency of the matrix towards embrittlement was found. Therefore, it is mandatory to consider stress amplitude and means stress as inseparable load characteristic for fatigue assessment, which additionally is influenced by production-related and time-dependent residual stresses. The phenomenological findings are incorporated to a numerical simulation framework on the layer level to provide an improved engineering tool for designing composite structures.",Block-loading | Fatigue | FRP | Load reversal | Modeling | Residual stresses,8,1,DFG,281870175,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

For validating a newly developed analytical calculation method for the layer-by-layer stress-strain analysis of thin-walled notched multilayered composites with finite outer boundary, the strain field of specimen with cut-out is experimentally determined. For this reason, a unique flexural testing device is enhanced and adapted for composites undergoing large deflection. The strains and their gradients around the cut-out are measured using a digital image correlation technique. Beyond that, especially for the investigation of small measuring fields with a high local resolution and/or with a large relocation during the experiment, a new tracking method for the measurement system is developed and applied. In the case of specimen deflection caused by bending, that system keeps the relative distance and position between the measuring field on the specimen and the optical measuring system within the allowable range.

All rights reserved. In-situ measurements of the deformation and of the structural dynamical behavior of moving composite structures, such as rotors made of glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP), are necessary in order to validate newly developed simulation models. Local methods like strain gauges and fiber Bragg gratings lack spatial resolution, while contactless optical methods like image correlation or speckle interferometry suffer from noise effects in the presence of fast rigid body movements. A novel compact sensor - based on the diffraction grating method - is introduced for spatially and temporally resolved strain measurement. The use of a line camera allows the measurement of vibrations up to several tens of kHz. With a scanning movement, strain fields at submillimeter resolution can be recorded. The use of two diffraction orders and an objective lens reduces cross sensitivities to rigid body movements on the strain measurement by two to three orders of magnitude. A validation on a GFRP probe was conducted in a quasi-static tensile test with an optical extensometer up to 14500. Furthermore, a strain measurement on a moving rotor at surface speeds up to 75 m/s was performed and the results were compared with those of strain gauges as a gold standard. The statistical standard deviation was around 10 and independent of the rotational speed.",Beugungsgitter | Dehnungsmessung | Faserverbundwerkstoff | hohe Ortsauflösung | In-Situ,2,0,DFG,Cz55/38-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The analysis of the structural dynamic behaviour of composite rotor–discs by a valid description of the eigenfrequencies and mode shapes can provide significant information for action-taking before a failure occurs. Specifically, vibration-based diagnostic methods, which are able to take into consideration the interdependencies and sequential changes of the modal properties could benefit from such an analysis. Here, on the example of composite rotors, a correlation method for experimentally determined mode shapes is developed. For this purpose the ZERNIKE polynomials are used to enhance the identification of mode shapes. Furthermore, the modal assurance criterion (MAC) in combination with the frequency response criterion and a data processing approach are applied in order to characterize changing modal properties of composite rotors.

Efficient production process chains are a prerequisite for a novel automated process for the large-volume production of lightweight structures. The authors demonstrated that by combining high-strength steel, continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic (organic sheet) and long fiber reinforced thermoplastic molding compound (LFT), components can be produced efficiently in “3D-Hybrid” technology with high lightweight potential. To reach this goal - by reason of the complexitivity of these technologies - the development of novel simulation methods was required, which formed a link between the previous standalone solutions for process simulations and an interface to the structure simulation. Pure ‘a priori’ simulation models did not meet requirements for accuracy of obtained results. Furthermore, online quality assurance system in component manufacturing was developed, which enabled continuous data measurement of the production parameters in all process steps.

Microcrack formation and delamination growth are the main damage mechanisms in the fatigue of composites. They lead to significant stiffness loss, introduce stress concentrations and can be the origin of subsequent damage events like buckling or fibre breakage, especially in case of shear and compression stresses during load reversal. Fatigue experiments of carbon fibre reinforced laminates were conducted at several stress ratios and analysed in terms of crack and delamination growth. These investigations were accompanied by microscopic imaging, digital image correlation and finite element modelling to take into account the effects of residual stresses and crack closure. It was found that residual stresses significantly change the local stress ratio in off-axis layers and lead to residual crack opening of inter fibre cracks. These cracks remain open and close under high compression loadings only. Furthermore, crack formation under pulsating compression loading turned out to be driven by residual stresses leading to perpendicular cracks as observed under pure tension loading. The experimental findings further confirm the severe detrimental effect of tension-compression loading on crack formation and delamination growth compared to pulsating tension-tension or compression-compression loads.",CFRP | Composite | Crack growth | Delamination | Failure | Fatigue | Fracture | Load reversal | Microcracking | Residual stresses,3,1,DFG,281870175,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

In order to create such multifunctional, so-called smart components, an integration technique for serial production, designed for embedding of piezofibre composites into thermoplastic structures, was developed recently. During the two-stage fabrication process, thermal and mechanical loads act on the piezoceramic, which can lead to partial depolarisation and thus degradation of the piezoelectric properties. Since the mechanical boundary conditions are significantly differing between the manufacturing stages, a direct determination and subsequent comparison of the piezoelectric values appears very difficult. Therefore, the effect of each process step of integration (here called integration step) on the polarisation state and polarisability of the piezofibre composites was investigated directly. The results indicate distinctive effects depending on the particular integration step. For the investigated integration technique, the overall depolarisation remains in a range which seems acceptable for low power applications such as sensing. However, for actuation the results suggest re-poling or poling after integration to assure maximum piezoelectric performance.",Integration | Piezofibre composite | Polarisability | Polarisation state,0,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

For the requirements of newly developed production processes like sheet bulk metal forming a previously developed measuring method exists for dimensional measurement of these manufactured parts. The presented multi-sensor approach allows the combination of several fringe projection sensors with different measurement resolutions and ranges to meet the requirements of the new production technology. The measurement setup includes a high precision hexapod to position the investigated workpiece inside the measuring volume. The measurement devices utilized are high precision fringe projection systems with 17 μm lateral and 1 μm vertical resolution. An additional overview sensor captures the whole measurement range of the hexapod. This paper presents two approaches that can be used for camera calibration and sensor registration of the fringe projection systems in a global coordinate system. A speckle pattern and a random dot pattern are placed on the hexapod to calculate the intrinsic parameters of the sensor camera and extrinsic parameters of the fringe sensor in one single step. To obtain metric lengths with the calibration process, a defined scale is included additionally on the pattern. The calibration process is executed by an automatic and random movement of the hexapod in the recording area of the sensors. Measurements show a direct transferability from the camera to the sensor coordinate system. This allows the measurement datasets to be directly merged together without the use of a separate registration routine.",Hexapod | Multi scale fringe projection; multi-sensor measurement system | Optical ow | Single camera calibration,0,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

All rights reserved. Virtual approaches to manufacturing processes are a common tool in developing components today. Simulations are always containing uncertainties like simplifying assumptions in computer aided modelling, material deviations, fluctuating external loads or other known and unknown influences. To integrate such uncertainties in an early design stage, the input parameters should be defined as intervals, because insufficient data may be available at this stage to provide probability distributions. To consider such epistemic uncertainties, a large number of intervals can be merged into a fuzzy number. For each interval a membership value is assigned which depends on the interval limits and an expert estimation. However, this interval modelling leads to a very high number of expensive evaluations, which is not feasible for a high number of uncertain input parameters. To reduce the calculation time, surrogate models are used. Here, the full model is evaluated only at some grid points and the system response is approximated by mathematical approaches. Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) offers a suitable surrogate model based on the Kriging method. The system model substituted in this way can be evaluated in an efficient way, but in addition to the uncertain simulation results, the approximation error dependent on the surrogate model has to be considered. Investigations of first prototypes lead to new knowledge that can be used to improve the surrogate model. Measurements, however, also include errors that are composed of systematic and random errors. The systematic measurement errors are specific errors for each measuring system and task, which are usually corrected during the measurement. However, an estimation of the random measurement error, which represents the precision of the measurement can be taken into account. Two methods are presented. Either an additional constant term is implemented in the standard Kriging or a superposition of two standard Kriging models, which are based on the simulation data and the measurement data, is used. As an application example a cold forging process of a steel gearwheel is employed.",Kriging | Measuring Data | Measuring Uncertainty | Surrogate Modeling,0,0,DFG,260682773,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Virtual product validation ensures that products fulfil their function under different varying conditions. Within the framework of virtual product validation, variation simulation represents the specific area that deals with the consequences of geometric part variations on functional key characteristics. In addition to the nominal geometry of the parts, the permissible part deviations in the form of tolerances, the joining sequence and process variations during assembly are required to simulate the effects of geometrical part deviations on assembly or product key characteristics. If the required quality targets are not achieved, the part tolerances usually have to be tightened, which goes hand in hand with increased production costs. The achievable part tolerances depend, among other things, on the material used, the workpiece dimensions, the manufacturing process, but also on the interaction between these factors. Therefore, the prediction of specific manufacturing process dependent deviations is hardly possible. However, if predictions should be made as exactly as possible, there is also the possibility to integrate measurement data directly or indirectly into the tolerance analysis. This has the advantage that material- and production-specific deviations can be considered in the best possible way for a certain part geometry. However, if measurement data is integrated into tolerance analysis, the problem arises that, in addition to the actual component deviation, the measurement uncertainty as part of the measurement result, must be implicitly determined in order to also be taken into account. Conversely, the tolerance analysis results are also influenced by the measurement uncertainty. To tackle this issue a novel procedure is presented which allows the quantification of the influence of the measurement uncertainty on the result of the tolerance analysis. In addition, it is shown how the measurement uncertainty is determined, whereby in particular the single point measurement uncertainty is dealt with. Since the measurement uncertainty can be different for each measuring point, Skin Model Shapes are used for tolerance analysis in order to have the possibility for defining point specific information. The developed procedure is then applied to a suitable case-study. CT measurements are used as the measurement method for determination of the single point measurement uncertainties. Finally, different scenarios for the tolerance analysis are compared in order to quantify the influence of the measurement uncertainty in the best possible way.",,0,0,DFG,HA 5915/9-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

In recent years there have been increasing attempts to enable the production of net-shape gears by forming methods. Cold forging enables improved material and energy efficiency compared to conventional gear manufacturing processes. In the extrusion process, a high surface quality, an increased hardness of the tooth profile as well as a load adapted fibre orientation is achieved. The procedure thus offers the potential to manufacture net-shape gears in a process suitable for series production. Due to the high tribological loads resulting from pronounced deformation and surface enlargement, the tribological conditions substantially influence the process result and the application relevant component properties. The tribological conditions are mainly affected by the applied lubrication system. The aim of this contribution is to investigate the influence of tribological conditions on the resulting component properties of cold forged steel gears. For this purpose different lubrication systems with and without a phosphate conversion layer are applied and the resulting component properties are determined. Phosphate-free lubrication systems offer substantial potential, especially from an ecological point of view. However, the high tribological loads during gear manufacturing pose a challenge. Based on the determined change of the tribological conditions and the resulting component properties, functional correlations are identified.

The operational behaviour of a gear pairing is influenced by the design of the gear kinematics as well as the component properties. With regard to an improvement of performance and service life, the targeted modification of tooth geometry and component properties offers a promising approach. Thus, the achievable geometric and mechanical component properties are influenced by the manufacturing process, which must be taken into account in the design process. The application of virtual evaluation methods is suitable for this purpose. For the manufacturing of steel gears, cold forging provides the potential of achieving beneficial mechanical properties in a highly productive process. Major challenges for the industrial application are the short service life of the cost- intensive tools and the low geometric accuracy in comparison to machining processes.

To achieve this within the framework of virtual product development, a wide range of aspects has to be taken into account. In this context, tolerance analysis has established itself as a proven tool to evaluate the consequences of geometric part deviations on geometric product characteristics. Existing approaches, however, do not sufficiently take into account production-specific deviations, leading to time-consuming iterations during the product development process. Therefore, the focus of this contribution is on process-oriented interdisciplinary tolerance management that allows the integration of manufacturing simulations into the tolerance analysis. In contrast to the conventional approach, this novel methodology allows to avoid unnecessary iterations in the context of product development and validation. Following the presentation of the novel procedure, the application on a case study of an X-ray shutter is carried out, whereby surrogate models are integrated in order to reduce the computing time.",Design for X (DfX) | Robust design | Tolerance representation and management,4,1,DFG,WI1181/8-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The application of innovative strategies based on electrochemical methods for an optimized conditioning of metal surfaces is investigated. The results account for a noticeable increase in the weld strength of steel-aluminum joints after a surface activation consisting of either an electrochemical roughening or electrodeposition of a bifunctional organosilane thin film. In addition to the surface activation process regimes for the pre- and post-welding heat treatment is investigated. Both weld strength and weld ability are improved due to heat treatments of steel sheets with various coatings and uncoated aluminium.

Internal Flow-Turning is an innovative rolling process for the manufacture of tailored tubes with a variable wall thickness contour over the longitudinal axis. The wall thickness distribution is determined solely by the internal diameter created by a special roller tool. The wall thickness is defined by the gap between the roller element on the inside and a die ring on the outside of the tube. The outer diameter of the manufactured tube can remain constant, thus greatly simplifying further processing by hydroforming, for example, or can be structured by ribs in the longitudinal direction. For this reason, internal flow-turned parts offer beneficial characteristics when used as semi-finished parts and are favorable for downstream processing. Depending on the tool design, a wall thickness reduction of >90% of the initial wall thickness is possible. In addition, the roughness of the rolled surface can be significantly improved. Through the incorporation of cold hardening in the process, the strength and hardness of the processed work piece can be improved by up to 70% of the initial state. Internal Flow-Turning is also well-suited to the calibration of a tubular part, since it provides tighter dimensional and geometrical accuracy. By using a die with longitudinal grooves, it is possible to form axial rib elements on the outer surface of the tube. The main subject of this paper is a material flow and forming analysis of the Internal Flow-Turning process. The focus is on a forming analysis in respect of the wall thickness reduction and the shape of various formed axial ribs.",,0,0,,undefined,

Straightening Machines are used in a variety of applications to level metals in semi-manufactured form before it is fed to subsequent forming operations. Roll-type straightening machines are designed to process either strips or bars e.g. The straightening process is based on flexing of the strip upon passing between rolls arranged in two staggered rows. This strengthens the material with increasing plastic deformation by means of strain hardening and implies undesirable reduction in formability when processing high strength materials in particular. However, conventional straightening processes do not adapt to the local varying distortion of coiled strips. The longitudinal bow as variation from a straight line in the vertical plane usually varies according to the related radius of the coiled strip. Thus, first turns imply small radii which increase with distance to the center of the coil. Conventional straightening processes usually adapt to the minimum resulting radius of the strip and, thus, overcompensate the longitudinal bow of the outer turns of the coil. This is accompanied by diminishing mechanical characteristics as formability in particular. Innovative self-correcting process control techniques which adapt to the initial geometric characteristics of the strip are a promising approach to fix this issue optimizing the leveling process. This Paper displays an innovative strategy to improve straightening of high strength steel materials (1.4310). The strategy involves optimized set up techniques which adapt to the current geometrical characteristics of the strip as longitudinal bow in particular. This implies optimized leveling adding minimal plastic deformation and, thus, strain hardening. The improved formability of the leveled strip promotes downstream forming operations to manufacture high performance parts with complex geometries at high strength such as plug contacts e.g.",,0,0,FOSTA,undefined,Forschungsvereinigung Stahlanwendung

A cold roll bonding (CRB) process for the symmetrical bonding of two sheets of the steel DX-51 (1.0226) with a galvanized zinc coating is presented. The coating was applied to form an intermediate layer between the two steel substrates during the bonding. The study is divided in two sections describing the role of the heat treatment prior to the CRB process (heat pre-treatment) as well as after the CRB process (heat post-treatment). The filming theory supposes that for establishing a firm bond, the superficial layers should feature an increased hardness in comparison to the substrate to overcome the oxide film on the surface. Since zinc is more ductile than iron, a bonding of galvanized steel sheets according to this mechanism is rather unlikely. By applying a heat pre-treatment prior to the roll bonding, the formation of brittle intermetallic Fe and Zn phases can be facilitated. These brittle phases fracture during rolling, and thus, allow for a contact of the juvenile formed steel layers. Within this study, steel sheets were heat pre-treated in an oxygen-free atmosphere in the temperature range from 450 °C to 550 °C. Additionally, the influence of the coating's thickness was investigated. A heat post-treatment was performed to strengthen the bond by increased diffusion activity. The influence of the zinc diffusivity was analyzed by heat treatment of the bonded samples in the relevant temperature range for zinc diffusion at 180 °C. The bonds were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and tensile shear tests.",,0,0,DFG,227635593,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Friction-spinning is an incremental forming process, which is accompanied by complex thermal and mechanical loads in the tool and the formed part. To influence the process temperature, two main process parameters, i.e. the rotation speed and the feed rate, can be adapted. With the objective to improve the tool performance and the quality of the workpiece, this study focuses on a coating concept for friction-spinning tools made of high speed steel (HS6-5-2C, 1.3343). Atmospheric plasma sprayed (APS) Al 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 -8Y 2 O 3 coatings serve as a thermal insulator, while physically vapor deposited (PVD) Ti 16.7 Al 21.8 Si 7.9 N and Cr 18.7 Al 22.2 Si 7.5 N films are applied to increase the hardness of the tools. In addition, duplex coatings, combining the APS and PVD technique, are synthesized to influence both the heat transfer and the tribological properties of friction-spinning tools. Subsequently, all coated tools are tested in a friction-spinning process to form flanges made of AW-6060 (AlMgSi—3.3206) tube materials. The tool temperatures are determined in situ to investigate the impact of the tool coating on the process temperature. Compared to an uncoated tool, the alumina and zirconia coatings contribute to a reduction of the tool temperature by up to half, while the PVD films increase the hardness of the tool by 20 GPa. Furthermore, it is shown that the surface quality of thermally sprayed or PVD coated tools is directly related to the surface roughness of the resulting workpiece.",(Ti/Cr)AlSiN | Duplex coating | Friction-spinning | Process temperature | Surface roughness | Thermal barrier coating,1,0,DFG,HO 2356/11-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

These aims can be achieved by reducing the weight of the car, which further improves the driving dynamics. In most currently mass-produced cars, the body accounts for one of the largest parts by weight, and hence designing a lightweight car body assumes great importance for reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. Extremely lightweight designs can be achieved by using purely composite materials, which are very light but also highly cost intensive and not yet suitable for large scale production due to the necessity of manual processing. A promising approach for the automated, large-scale production of lightweight car structures with a high stiffness to weight ratio is the combination of high strength steel alloys and CFRP prepregs in a special hybrid material/fiber metal laminate (FML) – which can be further processed by forming technologies such as deep drawing.

In this way, components can be developed which have both significantly increased specific properties (strength and stiffness with respect to density) and high energy absorption capacity compared with conventional design with mono materials. However, the structural behaviour of crash structures is decisively determined by material behaviour of the thermoplastic and metal constituents as well as the interface properties between both constituents and the corresponding delamination behaviour. To evaluate the structural response of multi-layered fibre-metal-laminates under highly dynamic loading conditions, Charpy tests were performed, where the test parameters, light metal material configuration, support length and laminate thickness, were varied. Moreover, the metal sheet surfaces were pre-treated by embossing to achieve different surface topologies.

This work proposes a novel technique for the localization of low-velocity impacts in composites without a-priori knowledge of the mechanical properties nor the speed of propagating waves, thus overcoming current limitations of existing impact localization methods. The proposed algorithm is based on the estimation of the power of acoustic emissions generated by impacts on a composite plate instrumented with embedded piezo-transducers. The signal power values calculated at sparse sensor locations are interpolated over the sample by using radial basis function networks. The impact coordinates on the specimen surface are estimated by a center-of-gravity method based on the interpolated power values. Experimental tests were performed by using both an instrumented impact hammer and a drop tower. The results obtained showed the validity of the presented approach, which was able to identify the impact locations with high level of accuracy.",composite materials | embedded transducers | Impact localization | radial basis functions | signal power method,6,0,H2020,636549,Horizon 2020 Framework Programme

Published by Elsevier B.V. The total service life of structures or components that have been under cyclic loading is the combination of load cycles required to initiate a crack or multiple cracks and the load cycles needed to propagate those cracks. Thus prediction of fatigue crack initiation as well as fatigue crack growth is very important in determining the lifetime of structures. Various simulation programs are available to foresee the fatigue crack growth and to calculate load cycles required for crack growth. ADAPCRACK3D is one such automatic crack growth simulation program which uses finite element method to simulate crack growth behavior in 3D structures. It also calculates the crack path, crack growth rate and the load cycles needed for the crack growth up until failure of the structure. ADAPCRACK3D generally uses mechanical and thermal loading conditions. Until now the software only calculates load cycles required for propagating an already initiated crack. Thus the user provided FE-Model contains the location and shape of the initial crack which ADAPCRACK3D uses for simulating the growth of the crack. This paper is an attempt to introduce a numerical procedure in ADAPCRACK3D for automatic crack initiation in 3D structures. 3D models are created with necessary loading conditions and without the initial technical crack. Simulations are performed on these models for finding the stress tensor and maximum principal stresses in the structure.

The load cycles required to initiate the crack are also calculated using the Smith-Watson-Topper damage parameter.

Complex injuries are not optimally treatable with standard medical methods, especially when joints or articular surfaces are affected. To achieve an intact and functional joint, the articular surface covered by hyaline cartilage must be restored geometrically correct. Since hyaline cartilage has a poor ability to regenerate, a damaged articular surface requires replacement. This article describes the CAE-assisted preoperative planning of the reconstruction of a defective proximal interphalangeal joint surface. While determining needed medical aids, optimization potentials for existing external fixators have additionally been detected. In the following, the development of an adapted finger fixator with extended pre-, intra- and postoperative adjustment possibilities will be explained. The optimized fixator therefore requires less intraoperative precision. Possible inaccuracies during the surgery can be eliminated due to the adjustment possibilities afterwards. Likewise, it is possible to respond to changing anatomical conditions during the healing process, which grants a greater chance of rehabilitation overall. The basic design and material selections for the fixator are defined through the usage of numerical methods. Subsequently, the reliability is tested by using experimental methods.",Additive manufacturing | External fixator | Finger joint | Transplant,0,0,,undefined,

An increasingly connected production in the sense of Industry 4.0 allows completely new possibilities in regard to improved and more efficient production and higher product quality. But a key factor to Industry 4.0 is a consistent data flow along the production chain. However, the exchange of data, especially between companies, still is a major obstacle to overcome in order to achieve the aforementioned advantages. Currently, there are increasing efforts to record and analyse data. But there is a lack of a holistic system to handle data, therefore commonly company databases or other inefficient methods are used. These solutions are limited with regard to data exchange since the ownership of data cannot be proven, production data has no unforgeable timestamp, which in turn hinders the generation of complete production history from the final product (e.g., car door) back to the semi-finished product (e.g., steel sheet). As a result, there is insufficient to no data exchange along the production chain. In order to solve these problems blockchain is a promising approach. At the Institute of Manufacturing Technology, an operational blockchain system was developed and implemented using standard production machines. With the combination of a quarto rolling mill and a 400t - press, representing the sheet metal supplier and a forming company, respectively, the typical process chain of sheet metal processing is represented, which allows the detailed investigation of the established blockchain in this field of application.

Within this paper, resistance element welding joints of sheet metals in shear load tests are investigated. The resistance element welding process with upset auxiliary joining steel-elements is a possibility for joining multi-material sheet metal parts, using the standard process of resistance spot welding. In order to assess the potential of this joining process, it is necessary to determine the load-bearing behaviour under shear load by shear tensile tests.

The geometry of the test specimen is adapted to resistance element welding process conditions. Failure behaviour under shear load is analysed and related to the applied upset elements.

Due to high computational costs associated with stochastic computational homogenization, a highly complex random material microstructure is often replaced by simplified, parametric, ergodic, and sometimes periodic models. This replacement is often criticized in the literature due to unclear error resulting from the periodicity and ergodicity assumptions. In the current contribution we perform a validation of both assumptions through various numerical examples. To this end we compare large-scale non-simplified and non-ergodic models with simplified, ergodic, and periodic solutions. In addition we analyze the Hill–Mandel condition for stochastic homogenization problems and demonstrate that for a stochastic problem there are more than three classical types of boundary conditions. As an example, we propose two novel stochastic periodic boundary conditions which possess a clear physical meaning.

Aiming towards a reduction of the computational cost multiple numerical methods are therefore combined. One approach in the context of Finite Element simulations is given by adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. This allows to locally refine the mesh where it is needed, e.g. in the region currently exposed to the beam, while keeping it relatively coarse in other regions. Yet, the time step size of the model is constrained by the resolution of the beam path, which clearly limits the size of the problem under investigation.

Finite element simulation has become an important tool of process and production design in various fields, especially in the automotive industry. The calculation of forming processes in the early concept phase of new cars allows virtual adaptions, which can reduce costs of later phases in the product development significantly. Therefore, the precise characterization and modelling of the material behavior is necessary to ensure a robust and reliable numerical process design. The mechanical properties of numerous materials are highly influenced by the rolling or extrusion direction in the production process. This necessitates the characterization of materials in different loading directions. However, depending on the dimensional aspects of the semi-finished product, the manufacturing of specimens can be challenging or even impossible. Thus, in this investigation, an innovative, indirect approach for the identification of the Lankford coefficient in transversal direction is presented. Based on numerical and experimental data of layer compression tests the Lankford coefficient is determined by inverse modelling of the resulting specimen contour. Due to the characteristics of the layer compression test, it can even be used for semi-finished products with small transversal dimensions like extruded profiles. The presented methodology is on the one hand verified by conventional uniaxial tensile tests for aluminum as well as steel blank material. On the other hand it is used to determine Lankford coefficients for an aluminum extrusion hollow profile and the inversely identified material model is validated by comparison of strain distributions of experimental and numerical square tube bending tests.",Inverse parameter identification | Lankford coefficient | Layer compression test | Material modelling,1,0,DFG,DFG ME2043/45-2,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

As a result of the ongoing trend towards lightweight design in various industrial sectors like the automotive industry, mechanical joining methods become increasingly important. These methods make multi-material design possible, while thermic joining techniques reach their limits. Semitubular self-piercing riveting is a mechanical joining technology which allows joining dissimilar materials by using rivets as fasteners. The manufacturing of the rivets, however, is costly and time-consuming, as the rivets conventionally have to be hardened, tempered and coated after forming, in order to achieve adequate strength and corrosion resistance. By using high nitrogen steel for the rivets, these additional process steps are not necessary anymore. Hence, the rivet production becomes more efficient. Because of the strengthening, caused by strain hardening, high-strength parts can be produced by cold bulk forming of high-strength steels. Nevertheless, pressure-nitrided steels are still rarely used in cold bulk forming due to high tool loads, which is a major challenge for the manufacturing process. Under those circumstances, there is a need for new approaches to manufacturing with the aim of reducing the tool loads and realising the production of rivets made of pressure-nitrided steel. One possibility is forming at elevated temperatures below recrystallisation temperature. For this purpose, the influence of the temperature on the forming behaviour of high nitrogen steel is investigated. In this context, possible changes in nitrogen content caused by heating of the material and thereby induced negative effects on the material properties have to be evaluated. The results of compression tests at different temperatures demonstrate the distinct reduction of yield strength at elevated temperatures. Moreover, further investigations show that the heat treatment tends to result in a change of the nitrogen content determined using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. However, the changing nitrogen content does not affect the strength of the heat treated material after cooling.",,0,0,DFG,ME 2043/60-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Due to the rising demand for weight and volume reduction, the usage of high strength materials becomes more and more common. Regarding process forces, the application range of existing presses is limited in forming such metals. One approach to reduce the process forces considerably is superimposing the tool movement with ultrasonic vibration. Although the immediate occurring force and mean stress reduction were first discovered in 1955 by Langenecker and Blaha and are known phenomena, underlying effects of ultrasonic-based material softening remain object of current research. Prominent theories explaining the acoustic softening are stress superposition as well as surface and volume effects. By carrying out ultrasonic-assisted compression tests with 20 kHz oscillation frequency on pure copper, this study intends to determine permanently altered material characteristics. Therefore, compression testing with varying oscillation interval as well as amplitude is conducted and force-displacement-curves are analyzed. In comparison to conventional upsetting, an initial softening effect occurs after the unique presence of ultrasonic-assistance. Moreover, metallographic analyses support former findings. With regard to the examination of material flow as well as grain deformation, permanent microstructure alteration is found. In this way, temporary process-related and permanent material-induced effects are separated.",,0,0,DFG,ME 2043/69-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The increasing demand for closely tolerated and highly integrated functional components motivates the development of the innovative process class sheet-bulk metal forming (SBMF). SBMF is defined as the application of bulk forming operations on sheet metal to produce parts with integrated functional elements. Due to varying tribological loads, caused by the local forming of functional elements and the resulting complex material flow, the geometrical accuracy of the produced parts can be limited. A local increase or decrease of friction by modified surfaces also called tailored surfaces which control the material flow are an approach to improve the geometrical accuracy of the part. These tailored surfaces should be applied tool-sided to guarantee a short process chain. Consequently, the aim of this study is to analyze the potential of modified tool surfaces for a usage as tailored surfaces in SBMF processes. The tribological behavior of tailored tool surfaces is investigated to provide a basis for the selection of tailored surfaces. Different grinding and blasting strategies, as well as lubrication pockets are chosen as surface modifications and applied on the tool steel 1.3344 with a hardness of 61 ± 2 HRC. Lapped tools are chosen as a reference for the modified surfaces, since lapping is a widespread finishing process for forming tools. First of all, the topographies of the modified surfaces are characterized using optical and tactile measurements. Afterwards the tribological behavior of the surfaces is investigated using a modified ring compression test with specimens made of 1.0338. The resulting friction factors are correlated with the topography characteristics of the tailored surfaces to identify functional interrelations. Finally, the tailored surfaces are evaluated regarding their eligibility to adapt the friction and control the material flow in SBMF-processes.",,1,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The multi-material design of modern cars is a challenge for common joining technologies. Joining by welding is often not possible, due to different melting temperatures of the joining partners. Indeed, the usage of fasteners allows the joining by forming of high-strength steels with aluminium, but increases the weight and the costs. Common joining by forming technologies without additional fasteners are limited by the mechanical properties of the joining partners. Thus, clinching of ultra-high strength steels with low ductility, like press-hardened manganese-boron steels, is not possible. However, the innovative shear-clinching technology enables the joining by forming of ultra-high strength steels and aluminium without fasteners. In one combined process, the die-sided steel sheet is cut and the punch-sided aluminium is pressed into the cut out hole, resulting in a form and force fitting joint. Nevertheless, the cutting of the high-strength steel and the subsequent upsetting of the aluminium both lead to high tool loads, especially for the die. Thus, it is necessary to analyse the wear behaviour of the shear-clinching tool. Within the scope of this work, the tool wear behaviour in shear-clinching and the influence of wear on the process will be investigated experimentally. The focus will be on the die and the running-in phase, since there are no references for the wear behaviour in shear-clinching yet.",,1,0,DFG,ME 2043/37-3,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Modern automobiles are equipped with a large number of gear transmissions. In the powertrain, for example, they are used as multi-stage manual transmissions and in the interior for mirror and seat adjustment. Machining manufacturing processes—like gear hobbing and shaping—represent the state of the art in gear manufacturing due to high manufacturing accuracy and flexible machining possibilities. With regard to economic, ecological and technical aspects, cold forging offers a promising production technology. In conventional transverse and forward extrusion processes, the ejection process is a challenge due to high forces and a negative influence on the gearing accuracy. One variant of forward extrusion is the so-called “Samanta” process, whereby an additional ejection step is avoidable by sequential forming of the gears. For the establishment of this process in industry, the increase of the achievable gearing accuracy and the achievable tool life is of major relevance. Thus, a deeper process understanding as well as knowledge about the influences on the process results is beneficial. In this context, the aim of this research work is to produce spur and helical gears by the “Samanta”-process. In addition to the resulting component properties, the characteristics of the process are determined. On this basis, commonalities and differences in cold forging of spur and helical gears are investigated to gain a principle process understanding. These findings are also used to derive possible approaches for improving component and process properties in future research work. The results reveal that cold forging of spur and helical gears by the “Samanta”-process results in characteristic properties and specific challenges within the gear types.

Hot stamping is a well-established technology for producing safety relevant car components. The use of hot stamped components in modern car bodies offers the possibility of improving crash performance due to their high strength while simultaneously decreasing the fuel consumption by reducing sheet thicknesses and thus weight. Hot stamped components are mainly produced using the boron-manganese-alloyed steel 22MnB5. To prevent formation of oxide layer during heat treatment and subsequent forming process, AlSi-coatings are applied on the workpiece surface. Since hot stamped parts are formed at temperatures between 600 °C and 800 °C, no suitable lubricants have been found yet. Thus, severe wear and high friction occur during the forming process affecting final part quality as well as life-time of hot stamping tools. Consequently, measures for reducing tribological load during the forming operation have to be found in order to improve part quality and increase efficiency of industrial hot stamping applications. Within this study, the impact of the tool material on friction and wear is analyzed by comparing the tribological behavior of the newly developed high thermal conductivity hot work tool steel Thermodur 2383 Supercool with the reference material 1.2367. Both are characterized by means of flat strip drawing experiments under hot stamping conditions. The experiments are performed with different hardness values for each of the two tool materials. Furthermore, wear behavior is analyzed using scanning electron microscope and confocal microscope measurements of workpiece and tool. Hereby, fundamental wear and friction mechanisms within hot stamping applications are identified.

The ongoing miniaturization trend in combination with increasing production and functional volume leads to a rising demand for metallic microparts. Bulk forming of microparts from sheet metal provides the potential for mass production of those components by an extensive simplification of the handling. The advantage of a high production rate contrasts with the disadvantage of a low utilization of material. In this context, it is necessary to investigate suitable measures to increase the material utilization. To save cost intensive trial and error tests, numerical analysis could be an appropriate method for a basic process investigation. In this work, a validation with experimental results in the macro- and microscale was used to investigate the eligibility of the finite element method (FEM) for a basic process analysis. For a high transferability, the finite element (FE) models were validated for various tribological conditions and material states. The results reveal that there is a high agreement of the experimental and numerical results in the macroscale. In microscale, conventional FEM shows inaccuracies due to the negligence of size effects in the discretization of the process. This fact limits the application of conventional FE-programs. Furthermore, the results show that lubricated and dry formed blanks lead to the same friction force and process result in the microscale.

Surface structures are used for several applications in industry to enhance the characteristics of surfaces and therefore processes. One example is the Sheet-bulk metal forming process which combines the advantages of bulk and sheet metal forming. Due to the complex material flow and load, the tool surfaces do need adapted tribological properties. High feed milled surface structures have been used in the past to control the material flow of the sheets. But due the high stresses appearing, the surfaces show a running-in behavior which altereds the tribological conditions. Within this study, a pressurized air wet abrasive jet machining (PAWAJM) process is used for adapting the high feed milled surface in order to manipulate the tribological conditions. Therefore, the surfaces characteristics, residual stresses as well as the tribological effects were investigated.

Sheet-bulk metal forming (SBMF) processes are characterized by a successive and/or simultaneous occurrence of different load conditions such as the stress and strain states. These conditions influence the material flow and often lead to a reduced geometrical accuracy of the produced components. To improve the product quality, a control of the material flow is required. One suitable approach, the local adaption of tribological conditions by means of surface modifications of tool or workpiece, so-called tailored surfaces. To control the material flow and thus to improve the component accuracy, methods to reduce and to increase friction are needed. The aim of this study is to determine requirements for necessary adaptions of the friction, the identification of tribological mechanisms for different types of tool-sided tailored surfaces as well as the verification of the effectiveness of these surface modifications to improve the results of a specific SBMF process. The numerical analysis of a combined deep drawing and upsetting process revealed that this process is characterized by two areas of varying tribological load conditions. Using a numerical analysis, the friction factor gradient between these two areas was identified as a main influencing factor on the material flow. Based on this finding, Chromium-based hard coatings for the reduction of the friction and high-feed milled surfaces for an increase of the friction were investigated regarding their frictional behaviour. The results of the ring-compression tests revealed that the carbon content and the post treatment of coated tool surfaces are relevant to reduce the friction. The increased profile depth of the milled surfaces was identified as the main influencing factor on the tribological behaviour of this kind of tailored surfaces.

Published by Elsevier B.V. The application of bulk forming operations to sheet metals leads to an increase of the material efficiency due to the enhancement of the process limits compared to conventional forming processes. The main challenges within the process class of sheet-bulk metal forming are high resulting forming forces and a defined control of the material flow. Additionally, the initial blank thickness influences the resulting quality of the geometrical and mechanical properties of functional components, like synchronizer rings. Previous investigations have shown that the application of tailored blanks with a defined one-sided thickness profile can meet these challenges which lead to an increase of the sufficient die filling of functional elements in subsequent forming processes. Due to the further increase of the geometrical complexity with functional elements in- and outside of the frame like carriers or gear teeth, the layout of the tailored blank has to be adapted. Thus, a two-sided thickness profile is necessary, for achieving the sufficient die filling of the functional elements. One possibility for manufacturing these semi-finished parts is a flexible rolling process which is used within the presented work. Thereby, it is necessary to develop a new process strategy for achieving a material thickening on both sides, rolled- as well as die-sided. For enabling a homogeneous material flow, the deep drawing mild steel DC04 with an initial sheet thickness of t0 = 3 mm is used, due to a high formability of this material. The tailored blanks are hereby analyzed regarding the resulting process forces, geometrical dimensions like the sheet thickness, mechanical properties such as the hardness distribution and the resulting surface roughness in important areas.",Cold forming | Rolling | Sheet metal | Tailored blanks,0,1,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Published by Elsevier B.V. In times of electro mobility and increasing resource-saving, lightweight design and size accuracy are in a progressive rate important. Therefore, conventional sheet metal materials are substituted by lighter material systems, for example magnesium alloys. In case of magnesium alloys, a deep drawing process can only be realized at elevated temperatures due to the hexagonal lattice structure. Moreover, springback of the deep drawn part leads to a decrease in size accuracy. Especially in deep drawing processes at elevated temperatures with temperature-dependent material properties, the springback behavior needs to be analyzed. In this paper, a deep drawing process of a cross-profile is realized to analyze the springback behavior of a magnesium alloy AZ31 at various forming temperatures. Besides, an advantage of the cross-profile deep drawing process is a simultaneous determination of springback in 0 and 90 degree to the rolling direction of the sheet metal. Furthermore, the dependency on the rolling direction can be investigated for the same profile without the influence of a change of the forming condition. Within this examination, the geometry of the deep drawn profile is digitized and the springback behavior is examined by the springback angles depending on the rolling direction and the forming temperature.",Deep drawing | Magnesium alloy | Sheet metal | Springback,2,1,DFG,ME 2043/40-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Published by Elsevier B.V. High-strength sheet material can be fabricated by using the technology of accumulative roll bonding (ARB). The ARB-process includes a surface treatment of those surfaces which attach to one another during bonding. Surface preparation is followed by stacking and subsequently rolling of the sheets. The objective of the surface treatment is to clean it and to reduce the oxide layer that forms especially on aluminum alloys. Additionally, it increases the roughness of the surface. It is well known that the increased roughness and a minimum oxide layer show a positive impact on the bond strength between the single layers of the multilayered sheet. However, there is no systematical investigation on surface roughness generated by the use of different brushing parameters. The mechanical surface treatment described in this paper is conducted with an automatized brushing machine instead of a brushing tool which needs to be handled manually. The experiments are performed by using three different cylindrical brushes which differ from the brush type. Furthermore, the throughput speed and the brushing pressure are systematically varied. The material used in this investigation is the precipitation hardening aluminum alloy AA6014. After the brushing process the surface of the treated sheets is analyzed with regard to different roughness parameters and the surface topography. Finally, the hypothesis of being able to create a reproducible surface treatment using the brushing machine is reviewed and the significant process parameters are identified.",AA6014 | Accumulative Roll Bonding (ARB) | Brushing | Surface treatment,1,1,DFG,ME 2043/66-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Published by Elsevier B.V. Nowadays, light weight design leads to more complex geometries and the use of high-strength materials in metal forming processes. This fact generates a need of accurate material flow control during deep drawing processes. Commonly, this is realized and supported by the use of drawbeads. They are also one common possibility to regulate serial forming processes, like they are used in car body manufacturing. While retention or opening forces of different drawbead geometries are already well investigated, there are only a few examinations dealing with the forming limit of sheet metal after passing a drawbead. This investigation analyses the influence of a commonly used drawbead geometry on the formability of a mild steel DC04, an advanced high-strength steel DP800 and an aluminum alloy AA6014. First of all, the forming limit of all initial materials is analyzed by Nakajima tests to generate a normed Forming Limit Curve (FLC). Afterwards, metal sheets are preloaded in a modified strip drawing test with a drawbead geometry. As those strips are too narrow for conventional Nakajima tests, tensile test specimens A50 are used to determine one characteristic point in the forming limit curve. Therefore, A50 specimens in the initial and preloaded state are tested with a conventional tensile test setup and an optical measurement system. This is done to analyze the changes in the formability in the uniaxial stress state after a drawbead passage. Here, the evaluation method according to DIN EN ISO 12004-2:2009-02 is applied. Following, those results are discussed and the impact of drawbeads on different sheet metal materials is evaluated to specify the limitations in forming processes using drawbeads.",Deep drawing | Drawbead | Failure by necking | Forming limit curve,1,1,,undefined,

Published by Elsevier B.V. In conventional deep drawing processes lubricants are applied to reduce friction and wear. Demands for increased sustainability, environmental protection and resource efficiency motivate the realization of lubricant-free forming processes. The direct tool-workpiece contact during dry deep drawing leads to changed tribological conditions. Especially in the areas of increased normal and shear stresses, such as the die radius, the dry contact causes an increased risk of wear and damage to the sheet surface. A well-known approach to face the challenges of dry deep drawing of steel sheets and aluminum alloys is the application of amorphous carbon based coatings on the tool surfaces. Within this study the tribological behavior of conventional and modified tool surfaces at the critical radii area is investigated with a strip bending rotation test. In this test, the friction coefficient is determined based on the relative movement between a rotating test cylinder and a sheet-metal strip bent in a die. For the tribological tests the sheet materials AA6014, AA5182 and zinc coated DC04 are applied. The modification of the tool sided surface was achieved by applying ta-C and a-C:H coatings to the test cylinder. In addition to tests with coated surfaces, tests with uncoated tools are carried out for reference. By analyzing the resulting friction coefficients for the different sheet materials, the suitability of ta-C and a-C:H coatings for dry deep drawing processes is evaluated comparatively.

The forming limit curve (FLC) is used to model the onset of sheet metal instability during forming processes e.g., in the area of finite element analysis, and is usually determined by evaluation of strain distributions, derived with optical measurement systems during Nakajima tests. Current methods comprise of the standardized DIN EN ISO 12004-2 or time-dependent approaches that heuristically limit the evaluation area to a fraction of the available information and show weaknesses in the context of brittle materials without a pronounced necking phase. To address these limitations, supervised and unsupervised pattern recognition methods were introduced recently. However, these approaches are still dependent on prior knowledge, time, and localization information. This study overcomes these limitations by adopting a Siamese convolutional neural network (CNN), as a feature extractor. Suitable features are automatically learned using the extreme cases of the homogeneous and inhomogeneous forming phase in a supervised setup. Using robust Student's t mixture models, the learned features are clustered into three distributions in an unsupervised manner that cover the complete forming process. Due to the location and time independency of the method, the knowledge learned from formed specimen up until fracture can be transferred on to other forming processes that were prematurely stopped and assessed using metallographic examinations, enabling probabilistic cluster membership assignments for each frame of the forming sequence. The generalization of the method to unseen materials is evaluated in multiple experiments, and additionally tested on an aluminum alloy AA5182, which is characterized by Portevin-LE Chatlier effects.",Deep learning | Forming limit curve | Machine learning | Pattern recognition | Sheet metal forming,5,1,FAU,DFG ME 2043/59-1,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg

High-strength aluminum alloys are promising materials for automotive structural parts since they offer a great potential to reduce vehicle weight and greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, 7000-series aluminum alloys recently became object of many investigations. However, one major drawback of these alloys is their poor corrosion behavior, which is a crucial aspect and currently limits its application in automotive industry. One approach to influence this factor, without changing the alloying system, is the accumulative roll bonding (ARB) process. Within this contribution, a multilayered material consisting of discrete layers of AA7075 and AA1050 will be manufactured via ARB. The influence of the ARB process on the resulting mechanical properties of the multilayered material will be evaluated applying tensile tests and it will be compared with the initial condition of both single layered materials.

Hereby, the load-optimized design of body parts and the reduction of wall thicknesses are enabled. But, due to the use of dissimilar materials, common joining technologies are reaching their limits. On the one hand, joining by welding is often not possible because of different melting temperatures. On the other hand, joining by forming with additional fasteners increases the cycle time and the costs. However, joining by forming without fasteners is often limited by the mechanical properties of the joining partners. The innovative shear-clinching technology combines shear-cutting and clinching in a single stage process and thereby enables joining by forming of materials with high differences regarding their mechanical properties. However, by the combination of the sub-processes cutting and joining, the complexity of the technology is increased.

The increasing use of hot-formed steels for structural components in lightweight construction requires solutions to create mounting points into the thin blank of high-strength steel. Compared to welding nuts, self-piercing nuts are often used due to advantages for the mechanical properties. The problems of setting these elements in hot-formed steels like 22MnB5 are high process forces and often limited undercuts, which are produced during the joining process. In this regard, the application of the self-piercing nut during the hot forming process of 22MnB5 is the focus of the investigation. The particular challenge is to find out the desired process parameter in a defined temperature window. Thus, the ductile austenitized 22MnB5 is exploited, while the local shape of the deformed blank in contact with the self-piercing nut is realized. A newly developed process enables insertion of the self-piercing nuts by different joining conditions. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the new process, various aspects are recorded. To achieve a successful hot forming process by a complete martensitic microstructure transformation, a minimum cooling rate of 27 K/s is provided. Furthermore, it has to be assured, that there is no thermal influence on the nut element, while the blank and the self-piercing nut are strongly heated.

Due to restrictions imposed by legal requirements, automotive manufacturers are forced to reduce the pollutants emission of new models. A promising approach is the reduction of the vehicle weight, whereby the body in white offers great potential. This weight reduction is realized by new car body constructions, which contain the increasing usage of different materials. Furthermore, new lightweight materials like TWIP steels become more important. The successful and economic implementation of multi-material design with TWIP steels requires the availability of suitable joining technologies. Conventional thermal joining technologies can be used in consideration of specific characteristics related to welding austenitic steels. Within the project, challenging material combinations related to dissimilar materials are investigated. In this paper, high-speed joining is investigated as an innovative and promising joining technology for multi-material applications. This mechanical joining technology contains an auxiliary joining part, called tack, which is driven with high speed into the joining partners. The challenges as well as the optimization of the auxiliary joining part is shown. The investigations are attended by metallographic analysis, whereby mechanical properties are determined through destructive tests.

This paper deals with the fuzzy dynamics of multibody systems with polymorphic uncertainty in the material microstructure. Macroscopic material properties are obtained using fuzzy-stochastic FEM based computational homogenization. In particular, the spectral stochastic local FEM is utilized to simulate a representative volume element of the microstructure. Forward dynamics of the macroscopic system is modeled using the Graph Follower algorithm. Thereby we propagate the uncertainty from the lowest level of material microstructure to the highest level of multibody dynamics. Differences in the propagation of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties to the macroscale and their influence on the multibody dynamics are discussed. A particular example of a multibody system used in this paper is a multistory frame, whereby the considered heterogeneous material is a cement-based concrete.",Computational homogenization | Epistemic uncertainty | Forward dynamics simulation | Fuzzy numbers | Stochastic FEM | α-cut-optimization,1,0,,SPP1886,

In this work we review a unified formulation for spectral fuzzy, spectral stochastic, and spectral fuzzy–stochastic FEM. We propose some modifications for the fuzzy and fuzzy–stochastic FEM involving local bases in the non-deterministic dimensions and the incorporation of extended FEM into the non-deterministic FEM. These modifications were previously used for stochastic FEM only. We discuss advantages of the proposed techniques for problems with uncertainties in the geometry and demonstrate their application to computational homogenization of heterogeneous materials with geometrical uncertainties in the microstructure. We address also some theoretical aspects of fuzzy FEM, that have not been tackled in the literature, namely the inner product of fuzzy variables. We address also another important problem, which becomes often the target of criticism of fuzzy approach. The membership function of the fuzzy input has often some degree of arbitrariness: it is known only approximately or it is constructed based on some assumptions. Here we propose a fuzzy FEM representation, which requires only the modal value and support of the fuzzy input parameters and is completely independent of the membership function's shape. We also discuss the case of imprecise probabilities which allows for severe dimension reduction of the non-deterministic problem if the accurate spectral simulation technique is used.

No matter whether the Monte-Carlo sampling or Smolyak's sparse grids are used, which may theoretically overcome the curse of dimensionality, the system evaluation must be performed at least hundreds of times. This becomes possible only by using reduced order modeling and surrogate modeling. Moreover, special approximation techniques are needed to analyze the input data and to produce a parametric model of the system's uncertainties.

Since bioresorbable metal alloys like magnesium and iron are highly interesting in biomedical applications, significant efforts have been made to decrease the degradation rate of magnesium alloys, as well as to increase the degradation rate of iron-based alloys. Since silver is known to act as an effective cathode for iron, in addition to its antibacterial behaviour, it is gaining more interest as an alloying element for iron. Unfortunately, silver itself corrodes extremely slowly, and the effect of silver in the nanoscale on the human organism is, up to now, still controversial. Therefore, new silver alloys based on rare earth elements, as well as on typical elements for biomedical applications (Ca, Mg, Zn) with an adapted degradation profile (rate, scale of corrosion products), are a focal point of this work.

This need has led to the development of various standards for the exchange of product geometry and related information and particularly to the emergence of STEP as a standard for the exchange of product model data. Though STEP is widely used as an exchange format in design and related domains, other standards and file formats are frequently used for transferring product geometry information from design to downstream activities today, such as the STL (Standard Tesselation Language) format, which uses a discrete geometry representation scheme for describing part geometry by an unstructured triangulated surface. However, there exists a gap between STEP, which offers great benefits regarding the documentation of nominal product geometry and product manufacturing information, and the STL format, which offers a discrete geometry representation by triangles. With the aim to close this gap, this paper presents a novel method that allows an automatic mapping of PMI (Product and Manufacturing Information) and GD&T (Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing) information assigned on the CAD model from STEP files on discrete geometries. The method comprises the interpretation of ISO STEP AP 242 files as well as a novel feature recognition approach. The combined data model, that represents the geometry in tessellated format and includes the GD&T information assigned on the triangulated features, may then serve as an interface model between design, simulation, manufacturing, and inspection and thus contributes to the consistency of product documentation throughout the digital thread in the product life-cycle. The applicability of the method is highlighted using a case study of a car brake system of industrial complexity. In addition, its benefits are underlined by the exemplary application of the method in the context of injection molding simulation and tolerance analysis.",Feature recognition | GD&amp;T | PMI | STEP | STL,7,0,,undefined,

Although mass production parts look the same at first sight, every manufactured part is unique, at least on a closer inspection. The reason for this is that every manufactured part is inevitable subjected to different scattering influencing factors and variation in the manufacturing process, such as varying temperatures or tool wear. Products, which are built from these deviation-afflicted parts, consequently show deviations from their ideal properties. To ensure that every single product nevertheless meets its technical requirements, it is necessary to specify the permitted deviations. Furthermore, it is crucial to estimate the consequences of the permitted deviations, which is done via tolerance analysis. During this process, the imperfect parts are assembled virtually and the effects of the geometric deviations can be calculated. Since the tolerance analysis enables engineers to identify weak points in an early design stage, it is important to know which contribution every single tolerance has on a certain quality-relevant characteristic to restrict or increase the correct tolerances. In this paper, four different methods to calculate the sensitivity are introduced and compared. Based on the comparison, guidelines are derived which are intended to facilitate a selection of these different methods. In particular, a newly developed approach, which is based on fuzzy arithmetic, is compared to the established high-low-median method, a variance-based method, and a density-based approach. Since all these methods are based on different assumptions, their advantages and disadvantages are critically discussed based on two case studies.",Computer-aided tolerancing | Density-based sensitivity analysis | Fuzzy arithmetic | Tolerance analysis,3,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Real components always deviate from their ideal dimensions. This makes every component, even a serial production, unique. Although they look the same, differences can always be observed due to different scattering factors and variations in the manufacturing process. All these factors inevitably lead to parts that deviate from their ideal shape and, therefore, have different properties than the ideal component. Changing properties can lead to major problems or even failure during operation. It is necessary to specify the permitted deviations to ensure that every single product nevertheless meets its technical requirements. Furthermore, it is necessary to estimate the consequences of the permitted deviations, which is done via tolerance analysis. During this process, components are assembled virtually and varied with the uncertainties specified by the tolerances.

However, they also increase the product complexity and cause new challenges in the production process. Therefore, agile production approaches are crucial. Tolerance compensation provides more flexibility in the production process, as demands on dimensional accuracy of the components are reduced. As a result, tolerance compensation also offers the possibility of reducing production costs without compromising product quality. Nevertheless, tolerance compensation is often considered a reactive intervention to reduce the number of out-of-spec parts a posteriori instead of including it in the early stages of Geometrical Variations Management. The contribution tackles this issue by characterizing and categorizing different methods of tolerance compensation as well as providing design guidelines for the application of tolerance compensation methods.

To reduce the required build time, it is useful to adapt the parameters with the greatest influence. However, since the contribution of the individual parameters is not readily apparent, a sensible choice of process and design parameters can become a challenging task. Thus, the following article presents a method, that enables the product developer to determine the main contributors to the required build time of additively manufactured products. By using this sensitivity analysis method, the contributors of the individual parameters can be analyzed for a given parametrized CAD model with the help of an analysis-based build time estimation approach.

Therefore, a large number of researchers is developing methods for utilisation of modern, but as well more complex materials with high lightweight potential. One subgroup of these materials are fibre-reinforced plastics (FRP). A lot of work is done supporting the design engineer in exploiting the structural and mechanical behaviour as good as possible. Whereas variations of laminate parameters, resulting from production, are poorly studied. Their impact especially on defined measures under load is of high importance, e.g. having a look on clearances in automotive industry. Because of the high complexity of FRP-parts, resulting from many laminate parameters, tolerancing is not an intuitive process. This is reflected in the fact that there is no defined procedure for tolerancing of FRP-parts. To support the design engineer the authors perform sensitivity analysis for simple loadcases to identify layers with a high importance on a defined measure. The results then are generalised to provide general guidelines to the design engineer.",Fibre reinforced plastics | Lightweight design | Simulation | Tolerance representation and management | Uncertainty,1,1,DFG,WA 2913/29-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Therefore, they need a database that exceeds common product data management systems. The creation of this database proves to be challenging because in addition to explicit standards and regulations the product design contains implicit knowledge of product developers. Hence, this paper presents an approach for the semantic integration of the engineering design (SeED). The goal is an automated design of an ontology, which represents the product design in detail. SeED fulfils two tasks. First, the ontology provides a machine-processable representation of the products design, which enables all kind of data-driven technologies. Among other representations, the ontology contains formal logics and semantics. Accordingly, it is a more comprehensible solution for product developers and knowledge engineers. Second, the detailed representation enables discovering of intrinsic knowledge, e.g. design patterns in product generations. Consequently, SeED is a novel approach for efficient semantic integration of the product design.",Knowledge management | Ontologies | Semantic data processing,0,1,DFG,WA 2913/22-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

These trends and new tools strongly rely on available data and will irreversibly change established product development processes. One example for such a new data driven tool is the plausibility check of linear finite element simulations with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). This tool is capable of determining whether new simulation results are plausible or non-plausible according to numeric input data. The digitalization and the increased use of data driven tools employing algorithms known from Artificial Intelligence also shifts the roles of many involved engineers. This paper describes and highlights this transition from current product development processes to a data driven / simulation driven product development process. Particularly, the shifts and changes of different roles and domains are illustrated and an example for changing roles in the design and simulation department is described.

Nevertheless, virtual reality has to face several problems, counteracting reliable use of the technology, especially in ergonomic and aesthetic assessments. In particular, the discrepancies in perception between the real world and virtual reality are of great importance. Therefore, we discuss these most important issues of current virtual reality technology and highlight approaches to solve them. First, we illustrate the use cases of VR in the product development process. In addition, we show which hardware is currently available for professional use and which issues exist with regard to visual perception and interaction. Derived from the depiction of a perfect virtual reality, we define the requirements to address visual perception and interaction.

In order to still meet the increasingly tightening of functional requirements, tolerancing as well as Robust Design practices became integral parts of the product development. However, despite the fact that the robustness of a product is mainly determined by its conceptual design in early design stages, these activities are usually carried out at the end of the design process. In order to overcome this shortcoming, this contribution shows a method that supports the selection of robust principal solutions and thus contributes to the design of product concepts, which are less sensitive to variations. The novelty lies in the adaption and combination of robust design criteria for the quantitative robustness evaluation in the conceptual design stage. First the product characteristics, which are relevant for the product robustness are determined on the basis of the function structure. By using an adopted VMEA and a newly developed evaluation matrix, this allows a thorough robustness evaluation of product concepts.

This tool allows the designer to assign part tolerances that take into account the achievable accuracies for a specific manufacturing process, while at the same time allowing for specific part properties.

Published by Elsevier B.V. In the context of modern industrial manufacturing, Additive Manufacturing processes are gaining more and more importance. Thus, the required quantity of material as well as the production time, which is mainly influenced by the build time required for the layerwise manufacturing process, are decisive for a successful industrial application. At component level, various approaches for minimizing the build time and the quantity of material are discussed in literature and are yet implemented in commercial software tools for preprocessing, the so-called slicing software. However, there is a lack of suitable methods for expediting the manufacturing process of non-assembly mechanisms. Although the positions and orientations of the individual, mutually movable linkages of a mechanism, which are defined in the CAD model, have a significant influence on the resulting build time and quantity of support material, the optimization potential has remained untapped so far. Motivated by this shortcoming, the paper introduces a method for achieving minimum build time and support material quantity using a metaheuristic optimization technique. By integrating a suitable slicing software in the optimization process, the analysis of build time and support material quantity is based on the machine code, which is adapted to the applied machine and its various settings of the process parameters. The novelty of the contribution can be found in the optimization of build time and support material quantity for the additive manufacturing of non-assembly mechanisms by determining an optimal positioning of the individual movable links for the manufacturing process.

Especially for reuse and adaptation there exists no suitable method for product designers to handle this information overload. Due to this, the selection of relevant information in a specific development situation is time-consuming and inefficient. To tackle this issue, the novel approach Intentional Forgetting (IF) is applied for product design, which aims to support reuse and adaptation by reducing the vast amount of information to the relevant. Within this contribution an IF-operator called Cascading Forgetting is introduced and evaluated, which was implemented for forgetting related information elements in ontology knowledge bases. For the evaluation the development process of a test-rig for studying friction and wear behaviour of the cam/tappet contact in combustion engines is analysed. Due to the interdisciplinary task of the evaluation and the characteristics of semantic model, challenges are discussed.

This can become quite relevant in the context of automobile electrification, where complex mechatronic systems are used. Consisting of various mechanical components, these systems perform the required function while being actuated by electronically controlled motors. To solve this, a novel mechanism for data driven portfolio analysis based on product platforms using knowledge-based systems is proposed in this paper. Further, the mechanism is tested by applying it to an electrical motors' case study. Using this method, all possible combinations of a product platform are calculated and finally displayed in different product portfolios. Additionally, all the non-feasible motor designs are removed from the solutions portfolio using the acquired knowledge base and performing design checks. The latter are employed for penalising and eliminating from the pareto-front of the designs, which violate the thermal, mechanical and acoustic constraints.

However, comprehensive knowledge is required for the setup of reliable simulations to verify strength and further product properties. Due to limited capacities, design-accompanying simulations are performed too rarely by experienced simulation engineers. Therefore, product models are not sufficiently verified or the simulations lead to wrong design decisions, if they are applied by less experienced users. This results in belated redesigns of already detailed product models and to highly cost- and time-intensive iterations in product development. Thus, in order to support less experienced simulation users in setting up reliable Finite Element Analyses, a novel ontology-based approach is presented. The knowledge management tools developed on the basis of this approach allow an automated acquisition and target-oriented provision of necessary simulation knowledge. This knowledge is acquired from existing simulation models and text-based documentations from previous product developments by Text and Data Mining.

However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product.

The interface between constituents of a multiphase material exhibits properties different from those of the bulk and can lead to major alternation of the material response. Interface effects are particularly important for multiphase nano-materials where the area-to-volume ratio is significantly large. In this contribution, we study the influence of a degrading general interface. That is, we allow for the initiation and accumulation of damage on a generalized interface accounting for both jumps of the displacement and the traction across the interface. The applicability of the proposed framework is demonstrated through several numerical examples. We present a parametric study on the influence of a broad range of interface material parameters on the overall behavior of various microstructures subject to volumetric loading and unloading. The numerical results illustrate that the resistance along the interface plays a key role in the resulting damage mechanism and could potentially prevent the detachment of the inclusion from the matrix regardless of the resistance across the interface or bulk material parameters. This behavior is observed and shown for both two- and three-dimensional examples. Moreover, the size-effect due to the general interface model is examined and compared against other interface models. Finally, the influence of the boundary conditions on the effective response and damage initiation of several microstructures is studied.",Cohesive interface | Computational homogenization | Elastic interface | Finite deformation | General interface,3,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

On the one hand the non-integrability of the plastic distortion results in the well-established dislocation density - often denoted as the geometrically-necessary-dislocation (GND) density - that enters the energy storage function. On the other hand - as entirely novel concept introduced in this contribution - the non-equilibrium of the plastic stress results in the disequilibrium density that parameterizes the dual dissipation potential within the convex analysis setting of plasticity. Consequently both, the dislocation density as well as the disequilibrium density contribute in modelling the size-dependent hardening state of a material in a continuum mechanics setting.

The floc shapes, sizes and free settling velocities are determined based on the experimental measurement of settling sludge flocs originating from a wastewater treatment plant. Based on the floc shape characterization, a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid is selected as the modelled sludge particle. In order to determine the main particle characteristics, e.g. the internal porosity, the density and the flow permeability, a Lagrangian particle tracking model is developed based on Brenner's drag model for a prolate axisymmetric ellipsoid and a buoyancy force model for a porous particle. The model is implemented for numerical simulations of the free settling process. The obtained floc characteristics are presented in the form of a two-part polynomial fitting curve, which can be used to model floc characteristics. The values of settling velocities of flocs computed by the model show very good agreement with experimental results. Futhermore, as the internal structure of a floc is seldom uniform, the nonhomogeneous mass distribution is considered, influencing the rotational and translational motions of the settling flocs. The nonhomogeneous mass distribution is introduced into the floc settling model. The parametric analyses of different barycentre offsets and shear rates are performed, and their influences on the free settling velocity are evaluated. The presented modelling approach can also be applied to flocculent settling of alum and other flocs in drinking water treatment plants. The developed Lagrangian model is suitable for use as a point source within the framework of Eulerian flow computations, and is solved as a two-phase flow model with a suitable Computational Fluid Dynamics code.",activated sludge | Floc settling velocity | Lagrangian particle tracking model | Non-homogenous porous floc | Prolate spheroidal floc,8,0,DFG,STE 544/58,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Such materials are indispensable in a countless number of industrial and scientific applications. Furthermore, the enhancement of ferroelectric property at reduced dimensions is crucial for continuous advancement in nanoelectronic applications. In this work, we investigate the onset of out-of-plane ferroelectricity in open-circuited stress-free BaTiO3 ultrathin films by performing molecular dynamics simulations using the core–shell model potential. In doing so, we try to obtain electric polarization hysteresis loops using an appropriate range of external electric loading. It is found that out-of-plane ferroelectricity is suppressed in ultrathin films with thickness 10 or less than 10 unit cells, indicating that there exists a critical thickness for the emergence of out-of-plane ferroelectricity in ultrathin films.

We present a computational framework to obtain nonlinearly elastic constitutive relations of one-dimensional continua modeled as special Cosserat rods. The kinematics of the recently proposed Helical Cauchy–Born rule is used to construct a family of six-parameter (corresponding to the six strain measures of rod theory) helical rod configurations which are subjected to uniform strain field along their arc-length. This uniformity along the rod's arc-length results in the reduction of three-dimensional equations of elasticity to just the rod's cross-section which further allows us to obtain the induced force, moment and stiffnesses of the rod by solving a nonlinear cross-sectional warping problem for every state of strain. The formulation is general in that the rod's material could obey arbitrary three-dimensional hyperelastic constitutive relations. A nonlinear finite element formulation is presented to solve the cross-sectional warping problem and further obtain the induced force, moment and stiffnesses numerically. Several numerical examples are presented illustrating warping due to bending, shearing and torsion in rectangular as well as circular rods and how the warping affects stiffnesses. We also obtain all the stiffnesses of helically reinforced tubes and show the variation in their stiffnesses with the tube's fiber angle.",Elastic constitutive modeling | Helical Cauchy–Born rule | Special Cosserat rod,3,0,DFG,1-3/2016,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

In this paper, a unified multi-mechanism continuum viscoplastic damage model is proposed to simulate the thermomechanical behavior of high-Cr steels at elevated temperatures. To represent the effects of material degradation under external loads, a total damage tensor is incorporated, which is composed of the low-cycle fatigue damage, the creep damage and the ductile damage. Within the small strain framework, the model is established through a thermodynamically consistent approach. First, some kinematic assumptions are proposed and the concept of effective stress is adopted. Then, based on a state potential with proper constitutive form, the constitutive equations can be derived from the second law of thermodynamics. By further considering the postulate of maximum dissipation, a Lagrangian functional is constructed through a regularization scheme. The stationary points of the Lagrangian functional yield the evolution equations of the dissipative variables. For the isotropic damage case, the damage tensor can be represented by a scalar damage variable and the constitutive evolution equations in the model can be simplified. To be prepared for practical applications, numerical integration algorithms are proposed to solve the constitutive evolution equations, and the material parameters in the model are identified based on the experimental data. To demonstrate the efficiency of the current model, it is applied to simulate the thermomechanical response of high-Cr steels under different loading conditions. The simulation results can fit the experimental data at a quantitative level and the damage mechanisms under the different loading conditions can be revealed. Besides that, the model is further modified to take into account the microcracks closure effect of the ductile damage. The current model would be helpful for the safety design and lifetime evaluation of high-Cr steel components in practical applications.",Constitutive model | Continuum viscoplastic damage mechanics | High-Cr steels | Numerical calculation | Thermodynamic formulation,6,0,NSFC,2016TQ03X532,National Natural Science Foundation of China

A general framework is presented to model coupled thermoelastoplastic deformations in the theory of special Cosserat rods. The use of the one-dimensional form of the energy balance in conjunction with the one-dimensional entropy balance allows us to obtain an additional equation for the evolution of a temperature-like one-dimensional field variable, together with constitutive relations for this theory. Reduction to the case of thermoelasticity leads us to the well-known nonlinear theory of thermoelasticity for special Cosserat rods. Later on, additive decomposition is used to separate the thermoelastic part of the strain measures of the rod from their plastic counterparts. We then present the most general quadratic form of the Helmholtz energy per unit undeformed length for both hemitropic and transversely isotropic rods.

The method can be applied to the computation of lift forces exerted on prolate spheroidal particles (or fibres) in arbitrary non-uniform flows. The method proposed in the Part I calculates the lift force arising from the dominant streamwise flow shear. In Part II the influence of the non-streamwise flow shear on the lift force is also taken into account. The present method assumes that the particle slip velocity is parallel to the fluid velocity along the particle trajectory. The novelty in the presented method is the computation of the shear lift force model for prolate spheroidal particles taking into account also non-streamwise flow shear. The accuracy of the novel shear lift force model for prolate spheroidal particles is verified by comparing it with the lift force model proposed in Part I via simulating the axial migration of a prolate spheroidal particle in the Poiseuille flow. In order to validate the ability of the present method for capturing the lift component arising from non-streamwise flow shear, the lift force model is compared with established generalised Saffman-type lift models by simulating the motion of a particle in lid-driven cavity flow. The computational results demonstrate that the present lift force model for prolate spheroidal particles is applicable in flow cases with streamwise and non-streamwise flow shear, even if some (reasonably small) accuracy for the case of the streamwise-only shear is lost.",Lagrangian particle tracking | Non-streamwise flow shear | Prolate spheroidal particle | Shear-induced lift force,4,0,DFG,STE 544/58,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Computational simulations–based on the field equations of nonlinear continuum mechanics–can provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms of brain injury and disease that go beyond the possibilities of traditional diagnostic tools. Realistic numerical predictions, however, require mechanical models that are capable of capturing the complex and unique characteristics of this ultrasoft, heterogeneous, and active tissue. In recent years, contradictory experimental results have caused confusion and hindered rapid progress. In this review, we carefully assess the challenges associated with brain tissue testing and modeling, and work out the most important characteristics of brain tissue behavior on different length and time scales. Depending on the application of interest, we propose appropriate mechanical modeling approaches that are as complex as necessary but as simple as possible. This comprehensive review will, on the one hand, stimulate the design of new experiments and, on the other hand, guide the selection of appropriate constitutive models for specific applications. Mechanical models that capture the complex behavior of nervous tissues and are accurately calibrated with reliable and comprehensive experimental data are key to performing reliable predictive simulations. Ultimately, mathematical modeling and computational simulations of the brain are useful for both biomedical and clinical communities, and cover a wide range of applications ranging from predicting disease progression and estimating injury risk to planning surgical procedures.",,27,1,NSF,CMMI 1727268,National Science Foundation

Although both computational and analytical homogenization are well-established today, a thorough and systematic study to compare them is missing in the literature. This manuscript aims to provide an exhaustive comparison of numerical computations and analytical estimates, such as Voigt, Reuss, Hashin–Shtrikman, and composite cylinder assemblage. The numerical computations are associated with canonical boundary conditions imposed on either tetragonal, hexagonal, or circular representative volume elements using the finite-element method. The circular representative volume element is employed to capture an effective isotropic material response suitable for comparison with associated analytical estimates. The analytical results from composite cylinder assemblage are in excellent agreement with the numerical results obtained from a circular representative volume element. We observe that the circular representative volume element renders identical responses for both linear displacement and periodic boundary conditions. In addition, the behaviors of periodic and random microstructures with different inclusion distributions are examined under various boundary conditions. Strikingly, for some specific microstructures, the effective shear modulus does not lie within the Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out at finite deformations to compare different representative volume element types in the nonlinear regime. Unlike other canonical boundary conditions, the uniform traction boundary conditions result in nearly identical effective responses for all types of representative volume element, indicating that they are less sensitive with respect to the underlying microstructure. The numerical examples furnish adequate information to serve as benchmarks.",circular representative volume element | composite cylinder assemblage | composites | Hashin–Shtrikman bounds | hexagonal representative volume element | Homogenization,7,0,,undefined,

Using poly(dimethylsiloxane) as an interphase in composites decreases frictional sliding and reduces interface abrasion. Different poly(dimethylsiloxane) polymers were used and analyzed concerning reaction yield, functional groups, molar masses, and molecular structures. The polymer grafting created characteristic nanoscaled patterns on the carbon fiber surface, which depend on the structure of the poly(dimethylsiloxane) species, and were analyzed with atomic force microscopy. The change in polarity from unsized carbon fibers to poly(dimethylsiloxane)-coated fibers was observed via contact angle measurements: Increases in hydrophobicity up to 120° were noted. Furthermore, the fiber resin interactions were directly influenced by the poly(dimethylsiloxane) coating and led to a decrease in interfacial shear strength from 10.3 ± 2.0 to 4.3 ± 1.5 MPa.",,3,0,,undefined,

Published by Elsevier B.V. In the scope of the study, the plasticity and ductile fracture behavior of additively manufactured AlSi10Mg tensile specimens were investigated at quasi-static strain rate experimentally and numerically. Small uniaxial tensile and notched test specimens were produced in three different scanning directions, i.e. 0°, 45° and 90°, by selective laser melting (SLM) method. Digital image correlation (Aramis software, GOM GmbH) was used to determine local strain fields on the specimens surface during loading. Simulation studies were carried out in commercial software LS-Dyna, LSTC. In order to predict the deformation behavior of the additively manufactured specimens, Cazacu-Barlat (∗MAT-233) was selected. The flow curve was extrapolated with Hockett-Sherby hardening law by the inverse parameter identification. The stress triaxiality is a highly significant factor that controls the initiation of fracture. However, unpredicted fractures are attributed to the evolution of pores in the material. The additively manufactured specimens show a high porosity. Heterogeneously distributed pores caused unexpected damage on the surface where the supported structure was produced and the specimens showed unstable behavior. Therefore, the initial failure started at the supported structure of the notched specimens. In order to interpret the damage evolution caused by pores, SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) images were obtained at fractured surface and non-damaged surface. The results showed that larger pores in structures are critical. For this reason, numerical specimens including randomly distributed pores were created and investigated to observe the effect of pores simultaneously. The numerical results showed that the existence of randomly distributed pores in the model showed more realistic description of the material behavior, especially in plasticity and fracture.",Additive Manufacturing | Fracture | Porosity,1,1,,undefined,

This simple approach comes with major drawbacks limiting the abilities of the MSM approach.

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Active membranes with switchable pores that are based on hydrogels can be used to measure the cell size distribution in blood samples. The system investigated in the present research is based on a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane that is surface polymerized with poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNiPAAm) to form active pores of arbitrary geometry. The PET membrane provides the functionality of a backbone for mechanical rigidity, while the soft PNiPAAm hydrogel forms the active pores. Modeling and simulation of the active hydrogel behavior proved to adequately predict the opening and closing of the pores under application of an activating stimulus, e.g. temperature. The applied model is called Temperature-Expansion-Model and uses the analogy of thermal expansion to model the volume swelling of hydrogels. The Normalized Extended Temperature-Expansion-Model can englobe arbitrary hydrogels and large geometric displacements. Studies of pore opening-performed by using commercial finite element tools-show good agreement of the experimentally measured shape change of active pores. Based on these studies, the particulate fluid flow through the switchable pores is analyzed. Through application of a membrane process, i.e. a given variation of applied pressure and switching stimulus for the hydrogel, the size profile of the blocking particles can be measured directly using the flux difference under constant pressure. This allows the measurement of the cell size distribution in blood samples, e.g. to detect circulating tumor cells or anomalies in the distribution that hint to anemia.",Hydrogels | Microuidics | Modeling and Simulation | Particle Separation | Permeation control membranes,0,0,TUD,undefined,Technische Universität Dresden

As a smart material, hydrogels react to different stimuli. These could be – for example – of chemical, electrical, mechanical or thermal nature. The hydrogels consist of a more or less crosslinked polyelectrolytic polymer network, depending on the conditions, components, and time spent for its fabrication. The reaction of these stimulated hydrogels is to uptake or deliver ions with hydration shells or solvent, followed by e.g. an elongation or bending deformation of the gels. Gels can reach enormous swelling ratios and are applicable as actuators, energy converters or sensors. In the present approach, the underlying physical phenomena of the chemical, electrical as well as of the mechanical field are incorporated in a homogenized way by using different partial differential equations. Local effects, e.g. the osmotic pressure differences in the mechanical field, are derived over reference and local concentrations. Depending on the type of the stimulus, the hydrogel reaction is more or less sensitive. For example, the mechanical reaction under chemical stimulation is far beyond the reaction under electrical stimulation. The applied coupled multi-field formulation is capable of providing local concentrations, electric potential distributions and displacements. The hydrogel model of a finger gripper is formulated by the use of finite elements. For the simulation the Newton-Raphson method and implicit Euler time integration are applied. Here only small volume changes, corresponding swelling ratios and deformations are considered. The results to different kinds of stimulation will be presented.",,0,0,,undefined,

The swelling/shrinking-induced deformation can generate large stresses which may lead to the failure of the material. In the present research, a nonlinear stress-diffusion model is employed to investigate the stress and the deformation state arising in hydrated constrained polymer gels when subject to a varying chemical potential. Two different constraint configurations are taken into account: (i) elastic constraint along the thickness direction and (ii) plane elastic constraint. The first step entirely defines a compressed/tensed configuration. From there, an incremental chemo-mechanical analysis is presented. The derived model extends the classical linear poroelastic theory with respect to a prestressed configuration. Finally, the comparison between the analytical results obtained by the proposed model and a particular problem already discussed in literature for a stress-free gelmembrane (one-dimensional test case) will highlight the relevance of the derived model.",Active materials | Incremental analysis | Polymer gels | Prestressed state | Stress-diffusion theory | Swelling/shrinking,2,0,EGU,100231947,European Geosciences Union

Downloading of the abstract is permitted for personal use only. Stimuli-responsive hydrogels are polymer gels possessing the ability to absorb or release solvent, resulting in a respective change of volume. This volume change can be triggered by applying a chemical or electrical stimulus to the gels placed in a solution bath. To describe the chemo-electro-mechanical behavior of these hydrogels in the framework of the Theory of Porous Media, they have to be subdivided in a solid phase, fluid phase and an ionic phase. In this theory, the interaction of the different phases is directly incorporated. Due to the complexity of both, the material and the model, a large amount of material parameters is essential. The determination of these parameters is a challenging task. In this investigation, also the interaction between hydrogel (solid and fluid phase) and surrounding solution bath has to be considered in order to determine the viscoelastic behavior of the gel. Hence, in the present work, polyelectrolyte hydrogels are investigated in consideration of the mechanical characteristics via a tensile test. In the experimental setup the stress is determined by a force sensor and the deformation is analyzed by using a gray scale correlation. Due to the fact, that the mechanical behavior of such multiphasic materials depends on the solid-fluid ratio, the gel is investigated under different swelling degrees. The acquired data then can be used to enhance the material equations. So, an enhanced prediction towards possible applications is gained.",Experimental investigations | Material parameters | Mechanical behavior | Polyelectrolyte gels,1,0,DFG,DFG-GRK 1865,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The conformity was quantified by the mean distance between plate and bone (MBP). The enhancement was completed when the median MBP of the population was below the SAC threshold.

The method includes all design steps from topology optimization to computer-aided design model generation and offers support to the engineer. The method is discussed in theory. A case study is done with a beam-shaped truss. It shows that if the bisection optimization method is combined with further constraints, it is suitable for selecting the optimum struts from a modular system for the truss.

In this context, many user-centred design methods only focus on single aspects such as subjective expectation or ergonomic product design. Correlations and connections or a common consideration of several user parameters are often neglected, even if this can provide useful information for improving the design of products. Dual user integration tries to close this gap to a certain extent and considers the user's subjective expectation in combination with their physiological capacities. An integral part of this approach is a target-oriented evaluation of the user. Currently available methods of physiological and subjective evaluation of the user are only partially applicable for dual user integration. Especially physiological measurement techniques are time-consuming and expensive. For this reason, this contribution presents a new concept for capturing and describing the physiological capacity of the user via semantic differentials. Thereby, motor functions, cognition and perception are considered.",Design methods | Dual user integration | Integrated product development | Physiological user description | User centred design,0,1,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The virtual environment of product development however, still has significant gaps in the virtual assessment and simulation of human factors, especially for user-product interactions composed of human movements. This motivates us to introduce a concept for data-driven prediction and analysis of user-product interactions. Heart of the concept is a predictive component that models the interaction between the user, represented by a musculoskeletal model, and the product, represented by product characteristics. We describe the implementation of this concept based on a pilot study for a lifting task. Motion capturing was performed to build a database and compare the results of our novel approach. The resulting kinematic and dynamic quantities show similar curve profiles with a small constant offset to the measured data.

Therefore, the aim of this study is to reduce polymeric wear debris of the inlay by using tribologically effective amorphous carbon coatings (DLC, diamond-like carbon) and thus to minimize abrasive wear. For this reason, amorphous carbon coatings were deposited on TÍ6A14V (3.7165; 39 ± 2 HRC) and CoNi35Cr20Mol0 (2.4999; 47 ± 1 HRC). The applied coatings are pure (a-C:H), silicon oxide-(a-C:H:SiO) and titanium-doped (a-C:H:Ti) amorphous carbon coatings containing hydrogen. Initially, the focus is on a screening with regard to the forms of wear. Based on this, wear mechanisms are to be identified in the medium term in order to deduce wear-reducing coating systems. The tribological effectiveness of the carbon coating systems can be favored in particular by a high adhesion on the substrate, so that further attention is paid to the mechanical investigation of adhesion. Subsequently, uncoated and coated samples were tested against medical polyethylene-ultra high molecular weight (PE-UHMW, 1401; HB=33 N/mm2) in a ring-on-disc test lubricated with fetal bovine serum (FBS). The wear particles are usually fibrous or particulate and have a size of at least 33.8 (im. This value is above the critical value of 0.1 Μm, below which increased macrocytic reactions are triggered even with a small abrasion volume, and thus promote the risk of osteolysis and aseptic loosening. A reason for the discrepancy of the particle sizes arises from the different in-vitro test setups (tribometer, knee simulator) and the in-vivo used joint replacement. In general, the wear volume should be kept low for particles in the order of 0.2...0.6 Μm.",Diamond-like carbon (DLC) | Ring-on-disc-test | Total knee arthroplasty | Wear,0,0,,undefined,

Nowadays, ergonomic evaluation of work can be done using Digital Human Models (DHM). One advantage is to reduce the need for corrective measures by supporting a more prospective ergonomic work design. Although ergonomic models provide useful information for risk assessment, single working tasks with minor changes in work place design are difficult to evaluate. Instead, biomechanical models can analyze single movements or body postures, taking internal forces in muscles and joints into account. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to establish an interface between a biomechanical human model (AnyBody) and the “Editor for manual work activities” (ema) to enrich ergonomic evaluation with biomechanical parameters. First results demonstrate that the automatically generated movements of ema showed some specific deviations relative to the subjects’ movements in experimental conditions. Optimization of kinematic data in AnyBody is necessary to ensure more physiological movements which are highly valuable for ergonomic evaluation.",Anthropometry | Biomechanics | Digital Human Models | Ergonomics | Human factors | Risk assessment,0,0,BMWi,ZF4263601BZ6,Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie

The study presented investigates the fatigue strength of the (α+β) Ti-6Al-4V-ELI titanium alloy processed by laser cutting with and without mechanical post-processing. The surface quality and possible notch effects as a consequence of non-optimized intermediate cutting parameters are characterized and evaluated. The microstructural changes in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) are documented in detail and compared to samples with a mechanically post-processed (barrel grinding, mechanical polishing) surface condition. The obtained results show a significant increase (≈50%) in fatigue strength due to mechanical post-processing correlating with decreased surface roughness and minimized notch effects when compared to the surface quality of the non-optimized laser cutting. The martensitic α’-phase is detected in the HAZ with the formation of distinctive zones compared to the initial equiaxial α+β microstructure. The HAZ could be removed up to 50% by means of barrel grinding and up to 100% through mechanical polishing. A fracture analysis revealed that the fatigue cracks always initiate on the laser-cut edges in the as-cut surface condition, which could be assigned to an irregular macro and micro-notch relief. However, the typical characteristics of the non-optimized laser cutting process (melting drops and significant higher surface roughness) lead to early fatigue failure. The fatigue cracks solely started from the micro-notches of the surface relief and not from the dross. As a consequence, the fatigue properties are dominated by these notches, which lead to significant scatter, as well as decreased fatigue strength compared to the surface conditions with mechanical finishing and better surface quality. With optimized laser-cutting conditions, HAZ will be minimized, and surface roughness strongly decreased, which will lead to significantly improved fatigue strength.",Barrel grinding | Fatigue | Fracture | HAZ | Laser cutting | Notch | Post-processing | Ti-6Al-4V-ELI | Titanium alloys | α’-martensite,4,1,DFG,ZI 1006/14-1,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

The present study investigates the cyclic deformation behavior of a new metastable β-type Ti–40Nb alloy (wt%) in two different microstructural conditions. Severe cold rolling followed by recrystallization annealing were performed on cast and homogenized Ti–40Nb rods to obtain a single β-phase microstructure at room temperature. Additional aging at 573 K was carried out to generate isothermal ω-phase precipitates in the β-matrix. Fatigue tests at cycles up to 2 × 106 and a stress ratio of R = −1 were realized with samples with electrochemically polished surfaces. EBSD analysis was carried out after the fatigue tests. Furthermore, detailed fractographic investigations as well as TEM analysis were executed. Results revealed significant differences in the cyclic deformation behavior and a higher fatigue strength for the aged condition. Reasons for superior fatigue properties of the aged condition are a pronounced precipitation hardening effect of the ω-phase as well as a complete suppression of stress-induced martensite formation and deformation twinning due to a barrier function of the ω-precipitates. In the vicinity of the fatigue crack tip, where the localized plastic zone dominates the damage evolution, precipitation-depleted channels can be observed. Within these ω-depleted channels dislocations have an increased mobility, allowing highly localized plastic deformation. Signs of other deformation features with increasing distance to the fatigue crack are not observed. EBSD analysis of the recrystallized samples with initial single β-phase showed on the contrary changes in the microstructure caused by the cyclic loading and the high instability of the β-phase. A dominant development of stress-induced α’’-martensite towards a full martensitic microstructure dependent on the applied stress amplitudes and cycles as well as additional isolated {332} <113> twinning were detected.",Cyclic phase transformation | Fatigue properties | Stress-induced martensite | β-type titanium alloys | ω-phase,4,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

Analyses of the fractured specimens in SEM and µ-CT show that two major mechanism caused the cracks propagating in an intermittent way. First, the crack front was pinned by primary precipitates leading to ductile bridges on the fracture surfaces. Overaging was observed to generally enhance the pinning potential of the precipitates. The second mechanism was crack extension in a shear-dominated mode but dissimilar to stage-I crack growth.

In this chapter, an introduction into the experimental challenges of fatigue testing beyond the classical fatigue limit will be presented. For many applications, strength assessment according to the classical durability (N ≤ 107) is no longer sufficient, since increasingly more components are subjected to cyclic loading up to the very high cycle fatigue (VHCF) regime. Recent studies have shown that the effective damage mechanism need not be inferred readily from low- and high-cycle fatigue (HCF) behavior of materials, since competing failure modes resulting from microstructural discontinuities play a prominent role in crack initiation. An identification of the failure-relevant microstructural feature poses a genuine experimental challenge, since from a macroscopic perspective purely elastic deformation is applied. Moreover, a shift from surface to interior crack initiation is observable for several materials. All of these aspects together with the need to test at elevated frequencies to reach numbers of cycles as high as N = 109 call for new experimental strategies. After a brief introduction of the motivation for VHCF testing and a short excursion into the world of VHCF-relevant damage mechanisms, an overview of highfrequency fatigue testing machines and their characteristic features is presented. Particular attention will be paid to the innovative test method of ultrasonic fatigue. A critical discourse of likely influence factors such as frequency and environment in the context of high-frequency testing is given. Finally, particular attention will be drawn to in situ damage monitoring during VHCF test conditions.",Damage mechanisms | Damage monitoring | High frequency testing | Very high cycle fatigue,0,0,,undefined,

The primary precipitates were found to act as microstructural barriers causing a local pinning of the crack front independent of the testing procedure and hence keeping the crack from extending continuously. This effect depends on the orientation of the initial crack with respect to the rolling texture which, in turn, determines the spatial distribution of the primary precipitates and the grain morphology. Overaging had a tendency to enhance the pinning potential of the primary precipitates.",Aluminum | Fatigue crack growth | Microstructure | Near-threshold fatigue | Ultrasonic fatigue,0,0,DFG,undefined,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft

In the present paper the aluminum alloys EN AW-6082 (peak-aged and overaged) and EN AW-5083 (solution annealed) were investigated regarding the long fatigue crack growth behavior in the range of very low amplitudes and therefore very high number of load cycles. The cracks were initiated at micro notches, prepared by means of focused ion beam technology and examined in situ by a long distance microscope. In first experiments the threshold for each material condition was defined. Subsequently the tests were carried out at constant ΔK values. Further analysis such as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and confocal microscopy were executed to analyze the fatigue crack growth behavior. A microstructural barrier function of the primary precipitates could be detected for each material condition. Grain boundaries seem to influence the crack growth only in case of the work hardening alloy (EN AW-5083), which is the material with smaller average grain size compared to EN AW-6082.",Long crack growth behavior | Ultrasonic fatigue testing | Very high cycle fatigue,1,0,,undefined,
